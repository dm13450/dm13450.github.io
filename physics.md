I graduated from the University of Manchester in 2015 with a first class MPhys degree in Physics with Theoretical Physics. I undertook a wide variety of different courses from gauge theories looking at the underlying of symettry of nature to non-linear physics looking at how animals obtain their stripes. 

My Master's project was  titled *Stochastic Dynamics of the Evolution of Cancer*. It combines various aspects of biology and non-linear physics. Please get in contact if you wish to see a copy.  

Noteable works from my earlier years include:

* [Pulsars]({{site.url}}/assets/CrabPulsar.pdf)

	A 3rd year labatory project invovling the study of pulsars and their properties. 

* [Dynamic Aperture and Frequency Map Analysis of the Synchrotron Radiation Source]({{site.url}}/assets/2ndyearreport.pdf)

	A 2nd year computing project on the dynamics of an electron in an accelerator.
