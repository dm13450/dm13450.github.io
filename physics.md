I am a 4th year MPhys student at the University of Manchester finishing my undergraduate study in Physics with Theoretical Physics.

Currently, I am working on my Master's project titled *Stochastic Dynamics of the Evolution of Cancer*. It combines various aspects of biology and non-linear physics. 

Noteable works from my earlier years include:

* [Pulsars]({{site.url}}/assets/CrabPulsar.pdf)

	A 3rd year labatory project invovling the study of pulsars and their properties. 

* [Dynamic Aperture and Frequency Map Analysis of the Synchrotron Radiation Source]({{site.url}}/assets/2ndyearreport.pdf)

	A 2nd year computing project on the dynamics of an electron in an accelerator.
