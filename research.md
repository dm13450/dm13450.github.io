My research interests include the following: 

- Predicting extreme values in markets and financial products. 
- Nonparametric Bayesian methods. 
- Point-process inference.

My PhD thesis was titled "Bayesian Nonparametric Hawkes Processes with
Applications". I took the standard Hawkes process, made some of the
components nonparametric and applied it to various situations like;
terror attacks, fx trading and soccer goals. All of the inference was
done in a Bayesian manner with the nonparametric bits using a
Dirichlet process. You can download my PhD [here](https://discovery.ucl.ac.uk/id/eprint/10109374/3/Markwick_10109374_thesis.pdf).

### Software

I have built a R software package for fitting Dirichlet processes. You
can download it within R using `install.packages("dirichletprocess")`
or by visiting the CRAN page
[dirichletprocess](https://cran.r-project.org/package=dirichletprocess). Any
bugs, questions or help can be discussed on the [github page](https://github.com/dm13450/dirichletprocess).

I've also built a Julia package for fitting Hawkes processes. You can
download it using the package manager in Julia (`add
HawkesProcesses`). If you like maths you can read the derivations
[here]({{site.url}}/assets/hawkesprocesses.pdf). If you want help with
the package use the
[github page](https://github.com/dm13450/HawkesProcesses.jl).

There is also the [AlphaVantage](https://github.com/ellisvalentiner/AlphaVantage.jl) Julia package that I've contributed
to. Use this if you want an easy way of pulling in financial market
data.

I've also got a keen interest in sports modelling, looking at how we
can predict the outcomes of various sports based on available
data. I briefly ran (a now defunct) website
[www.illiquidodds.com](http://www.illiquidodds.com) where I provided
odds on a red card across all of English football.
