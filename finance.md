My research interests include the following: 

- Predicting extreme values in markets and financial products. 
- Non-parametric Bayesian methods. 
- Point-processes inference.

I've also got a keen but more of a side interest in sports modelling, looking at how we can predict the outcomes of various sports based on available data.

You'll find me doing most of my work in R and Python.
