[Last time](https://dm13450.github.io/2021/08/05/questdb-part-1.html) I showed you how to set up a producer/consumer model to
build a database of BTCUSD trades using the CoinbasePro WebSocket
feed. Now I'll show you how you can connect to the same database to
pull out the data, use some specific timeseries database queries and
hopefully show where this type of database is useful by improving some
of my old calculations. You should read one of my older blog posts on
high frequency finance ([here](https://dm13450.github.io/2021/06/25/HighFreqCrypto.html)) as I'm going to repeat some of the calculations using more data this time.

I ingested just over 24 hours worth of data over the 24th and 25th of July. Completely missed the massive rally though, which is just my luck, that would have been interesting to look at! Oh well.

Julia can connect to the database of the [LibPQ.jl](https://github.com/invenia/LibPQ.jl) package and execute queries using all their functions. This is very handy as we don't have to worry about database drivers or connection methods, we can just connect and go. 


```julia
using LibPQ
using DataFrames, DataFramesMeta
using Plots
using Statistics, StatsBase
using CategoricalArrays
```

Default connection details to the database are used to connect to the database. 


```julia
conn = LibPQ.Connection("""
             dbname=qdb
             host=127.0.0.1
             password=quest
             port=8812
             user=admin""")
```

    PostgreSQL connection (CONNECTION_OK) with parameters:
      user = admin
      password = ********************
      dbname = qdb
      host = 127.0.0.1
      port = 8812
      client_encoding = UTF8
      options = -c DateStyle=ISO,YMD -c IntervalStyle=iso_8601 -c TimeZone=UTC
      application_name = LibPQ.jl
      sslmode = prefer
      sslcompression = 0
      gssencmode = disable
      krbsrvname = postgres
      target_session_attrs = any


Very easy, Julia just thinks that it is a Postgres database. We can
quickly move onto working with the data. 

I start with simply getting all the trades out of the database. 

```julia
@time trades = execute(conn, "SELECT * FROM coinbase_trades") |> DataFrame
dropmissing!(trades);
nrow(trades)
```

      4.828067 seconds (9.25 M allocations: 335.378 MiB, 1.64% gc time)

    210217

It took about 5 seconds to pull 210 thousand rows into the notebook. 


```julia
plot(trades.timestamp, trades.price, label=:none, fmt=:png)
```

Like I said in my last post, I missed the sudden rally on Sunday 25th
which was a bit unlucky. Side note, Plots.jl does struggle with
formatting the x axis with a timeseries plot. 

Now to move onto updating my previous graphs with this new dataset. 

## Order Sign Correlation

The correlation between buys and sells follows a power law. Last time,
I only had 1000 trades to work after pulling them using the REST API. Now I've got 200x more, which should improve the uncertainty around the previous values. 


```julia
ac = autocor(trades.side)
acplot = plot(1:length(ac), ac, seriestype=:scatter, label = :none, xlab="Lag", ylab = "Correlation")
aclogplot = plot(log.(1:length(ac)), log.(ac), seriestype=:scatter, label=:none, xlab= "log(Lag)", ylab="log(Correlation)")
plot(acplot, aclogplot, fmt=:png)
```

![png](/assets/questdb2/output_9_0.png)

In the log-log plot we can see a nice straight line which we fit a linear model on. 


```julia
using GLM

sideModel = lm(@formula(log(AC) ~ log(Lag)), DataFrame(AC=ac, Lag=1:length(ac)))
```

    StatsModels.TableRegressionModel{LinearModel{GLM.LmResp{Vector{Float64}}, GLM.DensePredChol{Float64, LinearAlgebra.CholeskyPivoted{Float64, Matrix{Float64}}}}, Matrix{Float64}}
    
    :(log(AC)) ~ 1 + :(log(Lag))
    
    Coefficients:
    ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
                     Coef.  Std. Error       t  Pr(>|t|)  Lower 95%  Upper 95%
    ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
    (Intercept)  -0.439012   0.049596    -8.85    <1e-11  -0.538534  -0.339491
    log(Lag)     -0.70571    0.0156489  -45.10    <1e-42  -0.737112  -0.674308
    ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

This time we've got a $$\gamma$$ value of 0.7 with more certainty. 


```julia
plot(log.(1:length(ac)), log.(ac), seriestype=:scatter, label=:none)
plot!(log.(1:length(ac)), coef(sideModel)[1] .+ coef(sideModel)[2] .* log.(1:length(ac)), 
      label="Model", xlab= "log(Lag)", ylab="log(Correlation)", fmt=:png)
```

![png](/assets/questdb2/output_13_0.png)

Lines up nicely with the data and better than the previous attempt
with just 1000 trades. $$\gamma$$ is less than one which means it is
 a 'long memory' process, so trades in the past effect trades in the
 future for a long time. This is usually explained as the effect of
 people breaking up large trades into slices and executing them bit by bit. 

## Order Size Distribution

Again, the size of each trade follows a power law distribution too. We use a slightly different method to estimate the exponent and last time with just 1000 trades we struggled to get a stable value. Now, with so much more data we can have another crack. 


```julia
uSizes = minimum(trades.size):0.05:maximum(trades.size)

empF = ecdf(trades.size)

tradesSizePlot = plot((uSizes), (1 .- empF(uSizes)), seriestype=:scatter, label="P(V > x)", xlabel="Trade Size", ylabel="Probability")
tradesSizeLogPlot = plot(log.(uSizes), log.(1 .- empF(uSizes)), seriestype=:scatter, label="P(V > x)", xlabel = "log(Trade Size)", ylabel="log(Probability)")

plot(tradesSizePlot, tradesSizeLogPlot, fmt=:png)
```

Using the same Hill estimator as last time

```julia
function hill_estimator(sizes_sort, k)
    #sizes_sort = sort(sizes)
    N = length(sizes_sort)
    res = log.(sizes_sort[(N-k+1):N] / sizes_sort[N-k])
    k*(1/sum(res))
end
sizes = trades.size
sizes_sort = sort(sizes)
bds = 2:100:(length(sizes)-1000-1)


alphak = [hill_estimator(sizes_sort, k) for k in bds]
plot(bds, alphak, xlabel="k", ylabel="Alpha", label=:none, fmt=:png)
```

![png](/assets/questdb2/output_17_0.png)

Still hard to make a judgement as to whether it is converging to a
value or not. It is always appears to be decreasing no mate the sample
size. Maybe I still need more data or maybe need a better
understanding of the Hill estimator! 

## Market Impact

I've not been using QuestDB to its full potential and repeating all my
previous graphs hasn't fully exploited the available features. One of those features is the
ability to group by the timestamp across a bucket size (1 second, 5
minutes etc.)  and aggregate the data. We will use that to
try and come up with a better model of market impact than I had in my
previous post. 

We aggregate the trades into 1 minute buckets and calculate the total volume traded, the total signed volume (sell trades count as negative), the last price and also the number of trades in each bucket. 


```julia
@time marketimpact = execute(conn, 
    "SELECT timestamp, sum(size) as TotalVolume, 
            sum(size*side) as SignedVolume,
            last(price) as Close,
            count(*) as NTrades
     FROM coinbase_trades 
    SAMPLE by 1m") |> DataFrame
dropmissing!(marketimpact)
marketimpact[1:3, :]
```

      0.223987 seconds (167.29 k allocations: 8.708 MiB, 56.20% compilation time)

<table class="data-frame"><thead><tr><th></th><th>timestamp</th><th>TotalVolume</th><th>SignedVolume</th><th>Close</th><th>NTrades</th></tr><tr><th></th><th>DateTim…</th><th>Float64</th><th>Float64</th><th>Float64</th><th>Int64</th></tr></thead><tbody><p>3 rows × 5 columns</p><tr><th>1</th><td>2021-07-24T08:50:34.365</td><td>1.75836</td><td>-0.331599</td><td>33649.0</td><td>52</td></tr><tr><th>2</th><td>2021-07-24T08:51:34.365</td><td>4.18169</td><td>-3.01704</td><td>33625.2</td><td>67</td></tr><tr><th>3</th><td>2021-07-24T08:52:34.365</td><td>0.572115</td><td>-0.325788</td><td>33620.1</td><td>46</td></tr></tbody></table>

This took less than a second and is a really easy line of code to write.

Now for the market impact calculation, we calculated the return bucket
to bucket and normalise the signed volume by the total volume traded
to give a value of between -1 and 1. This is taken from
<https://arxiv.org/pdf/1206.0682.pdf> and equation 26. 

```julia
marketimpact[!, :returns] .= 1e4.*[NaN; diff(log.(marketimpact.Close))]
marketimpact[!, :NormVolume] .= marketimpact[!, :SignedVolume] ./ marketimpact[!, :TotalVolume]

miModel = lm(@formula(returns ~ NormVolume + 0), marketimpact[2:end, :])
```

    StatsModels.TableRegressionModel{LinearModel{GLM.LmResp{Vector{Float64}}, GLM.DensePredChol{Float64, LinearAlgebra.CholeskyPivoted{Float64, Matrix{Float64}}}}, Matrix{Float64}}
    
    returns ~ 0 + NormVolume
    
    Coefficients:
    ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
                  Coef.  Std. Error      t  Pr(>|t|)  Lower 95%  Upper 95%
    ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
    NormVolume  4.55478    0.290869  15.66    <1e-51     3.9843    5.12526
    ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

Here we can see that there is a positive coefficient, $$\theta$$ in
the paper, as expected, and we can interpret this at how much the price moves after buying or selling. Specifically, in these minute buckets, those that contained only buy trades moved the market up by 4.5bps and the same for sells in the opposite direction. 


```julia
plot(marketimpact.NormVolume, marketimpact.returns, seriestype=:scatter, label=:none, 
     xlab="Normalised Volume", ylab="Market Impact (log(bps))")
plot!(-1:0.1:1, coef(miModel)[1] .* collect(-1:0.1:1), label="Model", linewidth=3, legend=:topleft, fmt=:png)
```

![png](/assets/questdb2/output_25_0.png)

You can see how the model lines of with the data and there is a very
slight trend that is picked. So overall, a better, if still very simple
model of market impact. 

## Trades with Top of Book

Now I've saved down the best bid and offer using the same process as Part 1 of this series. Over the same time period, the best bid and offer data has 17 million rows. So quite a bit more.

I use this best bid-offer data to do an ASOF join. This takes two tables with timestamps and joins them such that the timestamps align or the previous observation is used. In our case, we can take the trades, join it with the best bid and best offer table to get where the mid price was at the time of the trade.


```julia
@time trades2 = execute(conn, 
    "SELECT *
     FROM coinbase_trades 
    ASOF JOIN coinbase_bbo") |> DataFrame
dropmissing!(trades2);
```

      9.745210 seconds (18.49 M allocations: 671.544 MiB, 1.84% gc time)


This took 11 seconds, but was all done in the database, so no issue
with regards to blowing out the memory after pulling it into your
Julia session. Doing a normal join in Julia would only match
timestamps exactly, whereas we want the last observed bid/offer price
at least making the `ASOF` function very useful. 

We now go through and calculate a mid price, how far the traded price was from the mid price and also add an indicator for what quantile the trade size landed in. We then group by this quantile indicator and calculate the average trade size and average distance from the mid price. 


```julia
trades2[!, :Mid] .= (trades2.bid .+ trades2.ask)./2;
trades2[!, :Cost] .= 1e4 .* trades2.side .* ((trades2.price .- trades2.Mid) ./ (trades2.Mid))
trades2[!, :SizeBucket] .= cut(trades2[!, :size], [quantile(trades2[!, :size], 0:0.1:1); Inf])
gdata = groupby(@where(trades2, :Cost .> 0), :SizeBucket)
costData = @combine(gdata, MeanSize = mean(:size), MeanCost = mean(:Cost))

logCostPlot = plot(log.(costData.MeanSize), 
                   log.(costData.MeanCost), seriestype=:scatter, 
                   label=:none, 
                   xlab="log(Size)", 
                   ylab="log(Cost)", fmt=:png)
```

Unsurprisingly, we can see that larger trades are further away from
the mid price when they execute. This is because they are eating
through the posted liquidity.

This is very similar to my <https://cryptoliquiditymetrics.com/> sweep
the book graph which is *estimating* the cost of eating liquidity. This graph above is showing
the *actual cost* of eating liquidity for real trades that have happened
on Coinbase. 

We can fit a model to this plot and it is commonly referred to as the square root law of market impact. We ignore the smaller trade sizes, as they aren't following the nice linear log-log plot.


```julia
costModel = lm(@formula(log(MeanCost) ~ log(MeanSize)),
                     @where(costData, :MeanSize .> exp(-7)))
```




    StatsModels.TableRegressionModel{LinearModel{GLM.LmResp{Vector{Float64}}, GLM.DensePredChol{Float64, LinearAlgebra.CholeskyPivoted{Float64, Matrix{Float64}}}}, Matrix{Float64}}
    
    :(log(MeanCost)) ~ 1 + :(log(MeanSize))
    
    Coefficients:
    ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
                       Coef.  Std. Error      t  Pr(>|t|)  Lower 95%  Upper 95%
    ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
    (Intercept)    -0.534863   0.0683721  -7.82    0.0001  -0.696537  -0.373189
    log(MeanSize)   0.259424   0.0154468  16.79    <1e-06   0.222898   0.29595
    ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

The $$\gamma$$ value of 0.25 is pretty low compared to other assets,
which we would expect to be around 0.5. But we haven't included the usual volatility calculation which is in front of the volume component. 


```julia
plot(log.(costData.MeanSize), 
     log.(costData.MeanCost), seriestype=:scatter, 
     label=:none, 
     xlab="log(Size)", 
     ylab="log(Cost)")
plot!(-8:0.1:3, coef(costModel)[1] .+ coef(costModel)[2] .* (-8:0.1:3), 
      label="Model", legend=:topleft, fmt=:png)
```

![png](/assets/questdb2/output_35_0.png)

Apart from the small trades, the model lines up well with the
increasing trade size.

Using this model you can start to estimate how much a strategy
might cost to implement. At the end of the day, the outcome of your
strategy is unknown, but your trading costs are known. If it costs you
1bp to enter and exit a trade (round trip) but you only think the
price will change by 0.5bps, then your at a loss even if you were 100%
right on the price direction! 

## Summary

QuestDB makes working with this data incredibly easy. Both aggregating
the data using `SAMPLE BY` and joining two datasets using `AS
OF`. Connecting to the database is a doddle using `LibPQ.jl`, so you
can get up and running without any issues. Very rare that these things
happen straight out the box. 

Then by using this data I've ramped up the sample sizes and all my
plots and models start to look better. Again, all free data and with hopefully, very minimal
technical difficulty. As someone that usually finds themselves
drowning in csvs QuestDB has shown how much more efficient things can
be when you use a database.
