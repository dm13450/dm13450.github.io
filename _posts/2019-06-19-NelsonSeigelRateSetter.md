In an earlier post I looked at the
[yield curve of the P2P bonds](https://dm13450.github.io/2019/02/06/Ratesetter-Yield.html)
from [RateSetter](https://www.ratesetter.com/). In this post I'll be
taking the next step by taking a well known financial model and
applying it to the bonds to describe the yield curve. This model will
provide some parameters that describe the current state of the
RateSetter market and allow us to look at the overall history of the
yields.

```r
require(readr)
require(dplyr)
require(lubridate)
require(ggplot2)
require(rstan)
require(tidyr)
numIts <- 2000
```


## RateSetter Loan Data

First we need to download the data. RateSetter have recently changed
how they provide the data, now you can pull the csv files straight
from the website using `read_csv` of the `readr` package.

``` r
baseurl <- "https://members.ratesetter.com/ratesetter_info/marketrates_details.aspx?id="
url <- c(1,3,4)
contract <- c("Rolling", "1Year", '5Year')

rawData <- lapply(seq_along(url), function(i) {
  
  raw <- read_csv(paste0(baseurl, url[i]), col_names = F)
  names(raw) <- c("Date", "Yield")
  raw$Contract <- contract[i]
  raw
}
)

fullData <- bind_rows(rawData)

fullData %>% mutate(Date = dmy(Date)) -> fullData

ggplot(fullData, aes(x=Date, y=Yield, colour=Contract)) + geom_line()
ggplot(fullData, aes(x=Date, y=Yield, colour=Contract)) + geom_smooth()
```

Plotting both the raw data and the smoothed data we can see the
familiar pattern of yields that the different products RateSetter
offer. We filter down to the exact date all three contracts start
trading simultaneously and convert the contract name to a 'number of
months' until maturity variable. 

``` r
fullData %>% 
  filter(Date > dmy("23-02-2012")) %>% 
  mutate(Tau = case_when(Contract == "Rolling" ~ 1,
                         Contract == "1Year" ~ 12,
                         Contract == "5Year"~ 5*12)) -> cleanData
```

## The Nelson-Siegel Model

Now we want a mathematical model that can explain the difference
in yields between these products. A popular model in the fixed income
space is the Nelson-Siegel model which links the yield of the bond with
how long it has left until maturity. 

The Nelson-Siegel model for a yield $$y$$ of maturity $$\tau$$ can be written as

$$ y(\tau \mid \beta _0, \beta _1, \beta _2, \lambda) = \beta_0 +
(\beta_1 + \beta _2) \cdot \frac{\lambda}{\tau} \left( 1 - \exp (-
\frac{\tau}{\lambda}) \right) - \beta _2 \cdot \left( \exp \left( -
\frac{\tau}{\lambda} \right)  \right)
$$

where the $$\beta _i$$ values have direct interpretations of interest
rates and $$\lambda$$ is a scaling parameter. 

We can write this as an R function and use optimisation to find
the best parameters for a given dataset. 

``` r
nel_sieg <- function(tau, params){

  beta0 <- params[1]
  beta1 <- params[2]
  beta2 <- params[3]
  lambda <- params[4]
  tauScale <- tau/lambda
  
  y <- beta0 + 
    (1/tauScale)*(beta1 + beta2)*(1 - exp(-tauScale)) - 
    beta2 * exp(-tauScale)
  return(y)
}


likelihood <- function(params, yield, tau){
  -sum(dnorm(yield, nel_sieg(tau, params[1:4]), params[5], log=T))
}
```

We run the optimisation 100 different times at different starting values
to make sure that the result converges. 

``` r
cleanData %>% filter(Date >= dmy("01-12-18")) -> subData

replicate(100,
          tryCatch(optim(runif(5)*2, 
                         likelihood, 
                         yield = subData$Yield, tau=subData$Tau, 
                         lower = c(-Inf, -Inf, -Inf, 0.01, 0), 
                         method="L-BFGS-B"), 
                   error = function(e) NA)) -> optimList

optimVals <- optimList[which(!is.na(optimList))[1]]
optimVals <- optimVals[[1]]
optimVals$par
```

    ## [1]   5.28679720 -14.83033739 -15.86626221   0.07097706   0.60202616

These are the parameters that emerge. To check the model results, we
plot the Nelson-Siegel results against the actual yield curve. 

``` r
testTau <- seq(0, 60, by=1)
 estFrame <- data.frame(Tau = testTau, 
                        Est=nel_sieg(testTau, optimVals$par[1:4]))
 
 ggplot(subData, aes(x=Tau, y=Yield)) + 
   geom_point() + 
   geom_line(data=estFrame, aes(x=Tau, y=Est))
```

Its not a great fit to the data, but a sensible shape has been
recovered. What we do want though, is some uncertainty estimates around
the parameters. You can achieve this from the optimisation
results, but it would be better to use a Bayesian approach and get
uncertainty for free from the sampling. 


## The Bayesian Nelson-Siegel Model

We can rewrite the above model in Stan and sample from the posterior
distribution using Hamiltonian Monte Carlo. The Stan code can be found [here](/assets/NelsonSigelRateSetterPost_files/nel_sig.stan)

``` r
staticModel <- stan_model("../nel_sig.stan")

stanData <- list()

stanData$y <- subData$Yield
stanData$tau <- subData$Tau
stanData$N <- length(stanData$y)

smpls <- sampling(staticModel, data=stanData, chains = 2, iter=numIts, refresh=-1)
```

    ## Chain 2:

``` r
smplsEx <- rstan::extract(smpls)

allPars <- cbind(smplsEx$beta0, smplsEx$beta1, smplsEx$beta2, smplsEx$lambda, smplsEx$sigma)

testTau <- seq(0, max(stanData$tau), by=0.5)

allYield <- apply(allPars, 1, function(x) nel_sieg(testTau, x))

plotFrame <- data.frame(Tau=testTau,
                        Mean = rowMeans(allYield),
                        LQ = apply(allYield, 1, quantile, probs=0.025, na.rm=T),
                        UQ = apply(allYield, 1, quantile, probs=1-0.025, na.rm=T))


ggplot(plotFrame) + 
  geom_line(aes(x=Tau, y=Mean)) + 
  geom_ribbon(aes(x=Tau, ymin=LQ, ymax=UQ), alpha=0.25) + 
  geom_point(data=subData, aes(x=Tau, y=Yield), colour="red")
```

The model works and has recovered a similar answer to the MLE method,
but the overall model is not great. Many of the yields fall outside of
the 95% confidence interval, which suggests that this model is not
adequate. The daily yields change too much for the parameters of the
model. This means that we need to modify the model to something that
can change overtime.

## A Dynamic Bayesian Nelson-Siegel Model

A more general model is to allow the $$\beta$$ values to vary over
time. We rewrite the above basic model so that the parmeters at each
day of the week take on a value that depends of the previous value
of the parameter, this means that is can very with each day of the
week and there are parameters that control the amount of variation.

$$\beta ^{i} = \theta_0 + \theta _1 \beta ^{i-1}$$

This means that the parameter on day $$i$$ depends on the previous day
by a constant amount $$\theta _0$$ and an amount $$\theta _1$$ time the
previous value. 

Again, this type of model is written in Stan ([here](/assets/NelsonSigelRateSetterPost_files/nel_sig_dynamic.stan)), but now requires a
change in the data, we need to go from the long to the wide format
which is easily done using `spread` from `dplyr`. 

``` r
cleanData %>% 
  select(-Tau) %>% 
  spread(Contract, Yield) %>% 
  select(Date, Rolling, everything()) -> trainData

stanData <- list()

stanData$y <- trainData[,-1]
stanData$N <- nrow(trainData)
stanData$P <- 3
stanData$tau <- c(1, 12, 5*12)
stanData$forward <- 10

dynamicModel <- stan_model("../nel_sig_dynamic.stan")

smplsDyn <- sampling(dynamicModel, stanData, chains=2, iter=numIts, cores=2, init_r=1)
```

The sampling takes sometime (about an hour) but everything has been has converged
nicely. No worries about divergent transitions which is always a
success!

Lets look at the example yield curves. We will chose 5 days at
random from the training data and see how the fitted curves line up with the real data.

``` r
smplsDynEx <- rstan::extract(smplsDyn)

exampleInds <- sample.int(stanData$N, 5)

exampleCurvesDynamic <- lapply(exampleInds, function(i) 
  lapply(1:2000, function(j) 
    nel_sieg(testTau, c(smplsDynEx$beta0[j, i],
                        smplsDynEx$beta1[j, i],
                        smplsDynEx$beta2[j, i],
                        smplsDynEx$lambda[j]))
  )
)

lapply(seq_along(exampleCurvesDynamic), function(i){
  x <- exampleCurvesDynamic[i]
  cbind(
    Tau = testTau, 
    Mean=rowMeans(as.data.frame(x)),
    t(apply(as.data.frame(x), 1, quantile, probs = c(1-0.025, 0.025), na.rm=T)),
    Day = exampleInds[i])
}) -> exampleCurveQuantiles

dynamicCurves <- as.data.frame(do.call(rbind, exampleCurveQuantiles))
names(dynamicCurves)[3:4] <- c("UQ", "LQ")
dynamicCurves$Day <- as.character(dynamicCurves$Day)

do.call(rbind, lapply(exampleInds, function(i) {
  data.frame(Tau=stanData$tau, Yield=unlist(stanData$y[i, ]), Day=as.character(i), Model="True")
})) -> trueFrame

ggplot(dynamicCurves) + 
  geom_ribbon(aes(x=Tau, ymin=LQ, ymax=UQ, fill=Day, group=Day), alpha=0.25) + 
  geom_line(aes(x=Tau, y=Mean, colour=Day, group=Day)) + 
  geom_point(data=trueFrame, aes(x=Tau, y=Yield, colour=Day)) + 
  ylab("Yield")
```

Everything falls nicely in the credible zones, which shows how this
model is much better than the previous static one. It takes more time to
compute, but the benefit is there. The simple variation allowed in the
parameters can adapt to the available data. 

How do the $$\beta$$ parameters change over time? These are easily
extracted from the posterior samples and can be plotted as a function of
time.

``` r
ratesetterBetas <- extractBetaTimeSeries(smplsDynEx, trainData$Date)

ggplot(ratesetterBetas) + 
  geom_ribbon(aes(x=Date, ymin=LQ, ymax=UQ), alpha=0.5) + 
  geom_line(aes(x=Date, y=Mean)) + 
  facet_grid(Parameter~., scales="free_y")
```

![](/assets/NelsonSigelRateSetterPost_files/figure-gfm/betas-1.png)<!-- -->

Here are the parameters over time with their 95% credible
interval. What do these parameters represent? Here is a handy table:

| Parameter  | Meaning   |
|---|---|
| $$\beta _0$$   | Long term rates   | 
| $$\beta _1$$   | Short term rates   |
| $$\beta _2$$   | Medium term rates|


Now $$\beta _0$$ has been decreasing overtime which suggests that the
long term interest rate on RateSetter bonds is also decreasing. I
imagine this would be interpreted as confidence improving in the
overall platform, mainly because the Bank of England base rate has not
changed significantly over this period. The $$\beta _2$$ parameter has
remained fairly consistent at around -5 overtime, before recently
increasing. This is a bit tougher to interpret as there is no real
'medium' bond price that we can view the equivalent change
in. Likewise, $$\beta _1$$ started at a consistent value of -4, before
increasing from 2016 and decreasing in 2018. This shows the
sensitivity of the short-term rates, reflected in the rolling market,
which is by and large the more liquid contract and more likely to
experience fluctuations.

In early 2019, RateSetter changed their reporting practises and moved to
a 28 day window for reporting the average yield on each of the
contracts. You can see this change in the frist figure as the
fluctuations have suddenly dipped and the curves are now much smoother.
We can see a similar change to this in the $$\beta$$
values.

``` r
ratesetterBetas %>% filter(Date >= dmy("01-01-2019")) -> ratesetterBetasSub
cleanData %>% filter(Date >= dmy("01-01-2019")) -> yieldSub

ggplot(ratesetterBetasSub) + 
  geom_ribbon(aes(x=Date, ymin=LQ, ymax=UQ), alpha=0.5) + 
  geom_line(aes(x=Date, y=Mean)) + 
  facet_grid(Parameter~., scales="free_y")

ggplot(yieldSub, aes(x=Date, y=Yield, colour=Contract)) + geom_line()
```

![](/assets/NelsonSigelRateSetterPost_files/figure-gfm/betasub-1.png)![](/assets/NelsonSigelRateSetterPost_files/figure-gfm/betasub-2.png)

We can see that the parameters of the Nelson-Siegel model have now
smoothed out with the smoother yields as inputs. Again, good to see that
the model can handle a sudden change in the data. It also makes the
trend in the data a little easier to spot. The rolling market has
remained fairly constant, whilst the 1 and 5 year markets have decreased,
this is reflected in a decrease in the $$\beta_0$$ parameter, an
increase in the $$\beta _1$$ parameter and $$\beta _2$$ remaining the
same.

Now with just 3 unequally spaced contracts available to buy its hard
to see how these different time scales are present themselves in the
yields, but the fact that the monthly rate hasn’t changed much whilst
the other have decreased indicates that there is potential downward
movement on the cards for the monthly contract.

Like all blog posts that involve finance, I could be getting this
completely wrong, so don’t go trading the bonds based off this
information. 

A big help in writing the Stan code was this
[post](https://khakieconomics.github.io/2016/08/29/A-brief-introduction-to-factor-models-in-stan.html)
by Jim Savage. If you want to know more about the Nelson-Siegel model
you can't go wrong with
[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fixed-income_attribution). A
paper on [Arxiv](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1809.06077.pdf) does a similar
model for US Treasury data.

If you want to read more about RateSetter bonds, you can read my
previous post on the [basics of the yield curve](https://dm13450.github.io/2019/02/06/Ratesetter-Yield.html).
