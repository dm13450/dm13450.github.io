A few weeks ago I wrote a blog post about the speed differences
between `map` and `loop`. I posted it to reddit and got some feedback
on a) why the map was so slow and b) other ways the calculation
could be made which are just as quick as a loop. In this post I'm
writing about these new methods and adding them to the comparison.

## Previous Methods

For a more detailed explanation of the problem I'm trying to solve, check out my previous
post
[here](https://dm13450.github.io/2019/04/17/MapLoopPerformance.html). For
now I'm just going to recap.

```julia
using BenchmarkTools
using Statistics
```
```julia
clusterLabels = [1,1,2,2,3,3,5]
```

We started off with a simple `map`. 

```julia
function pointsPerCluster_map(clusterLabels)
    map(i-> sum(clusterLabels .== i), 1:maximum(clusterLabels))
end

pointsPerCluster_map(clusterLabels)

mapBM = @benchmark pointsPerCluster_map($clusterLabels)
```


    BenchmarkTools.Trial: 
      memory estimate:  21.73 KiB
      allocs estimate:  18
      --------------
      minimum time:     2.944 μs (0.00% GC)
      median time:      3.624 μs (0.00% GC)
      mean time:        7.479 μs (44.30% GC)
      maximum time:     9.851 ms (99.91% GC)
      --------------
      samples:          10000
      evals/sample:     8


It turns out this was slow because with each call of the function I
was creating a temporary array with `clusterLabels .== i`. To improve
on this I wrote the loop explicitly.


```julia
function pointsPerCluster_loop(clusterLabels)

    maxSize = maximum(clusterLabels)
    ppc = zeros(Int64, maxSize)
    
    for i in clusterLabels
        ppc[i] += 1
    end
    ppc
end
pointsPerCluster_loop(clusterLabels)

loopBM = @benchmark pointsPerCluster_loop($clusterLabels)
```




    BenchmarkTools.Trial: 
      memory estimate:  128 bytes
      allocs estimate:  1
      --------------
      minimum time:     53.756 ns (0.00% GC)
      median time:      82.478 ns (0.00% GC)
      mean time:        167.708 ns (21.97% GC)
      maximum time:     240.429 μs (99.95% GC)
      --------------
      samples:          10000
      evals/sample:     985


The loop method was the easy winner and orders of magnitudes
quicker. But now we've got some new methods to test.

## New Methods

The first two methods are from a reddit comment
[here](https://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/be9swi/speed_differences_between_a_map_and_a_loop_in/el4chty/). The
final new method is taken from the Performance Tips section of the
Julia [documentation](https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1/manual/performance-tips/index.html). 

### Generator 

First off, we use a generator. This is a better map implementation as
it doesn't create the temporary array, instead it runs a tally of how
many entries are equal to `i` for each `i` we are mapping across. 

```julia
function pointsPerCluster_gen(clusterLabels)
    map(i-> sum(c == i for c in clusterLabels), 1:maximum(clusterLabels))
    
end

pointsPerCluster_gen(clusterLabels)

genBM = @benchmark pointsPerCluster_gen($clusterLabels)
```




    BenchmarkTools.Trial: 
      memory estimate:  336 bytes
      allocs estimate:  8
      --------------
      minimum time:     128.594 ns (0.00% GC)
      median time:      135.287 ns (0.00% GC)
      mean time:        203.392 ns (26.73% GC)
      maximum time:     131.934 μs (99.77% GC)
      --------------
      samples:          10000
      evals/sample:     891

The results are in the nanosecond range, which is great, same order
of magnitude as the loop. 

### Broadcasting .

In Julia, to apply a function to each element in a vector you use `.`
after the function which easy vectorisation. For example `sin.(x)`
will apply sine to each element of `x`. Whereas `sin(x)` would error.
In this case we can create an anonymous function that applies to each
element of our array. 

```julia
pointsPerCluster_broad(clusterLabels) = (k->mapreduce(i->i==k, +, clusterLabels)).(1:maximum(clusterLabels))

pointsPerCluster_broad(clusterLabels)

broadBM = @benchmark pointsPerCluster_broad($clusterLabels)
```


    BenchmarkTools.Trial: 
      memory estimate:  128 bytes
      allocs estimate:  1
      --------------
      minimum time:     96.824 ns (0.00% GC)
      median time:      101.509 ns (0.00% GC)
      mean time:        136.465 ns (13.67% GC)
      maximum time:     94.869 μs (99.85% GC)
      --------------
      samples:          10000
      evals/sample:     947

Again, the average speed is in the nanosecond range so comparable to
the loop.

### Inbounds Loop

Another method of improving performance that the official
documentation recommends (with warning) is the `@simd` macro and the
`@inbounds` macro. These are compiler level optimisations that turn
off some of the safety features in the name of speed. With the caveat
that misbehaviour of the function could be catastrophic. We decorate
the loop function with these macros and test the results.

```julia
function pointsPerCluster_loop_inb(clusterLabels)

    maxSize = maximum(clusterLabels)
    ppc = zeros(Int64, maxSize)
    
    @simd for i in clusterLabels
        @inbounds ppc[i] += 1
    end
    ppc
end
pointsPerCluster_loop_inb(clusterLabels)

inboundsBM = @benchmark pointsPerCluster_loop_inb($clusterLabels)
```

    BenchmarkTools.Trial: 
      memory estimate:  128 bytes
      allocs estimate:  1
      --------------
      minimum time:     51.369 ns (0.00% GC)
      median time:      56.292 ns (0.00% GC)
      mean time:        80.677 ns (24.89% GC)
      maximum time:     87.980 μs (99.89% GC)
      --------------
      samples:          10000
      evals/sample:     986


Again on the nanosecond scale, so all is working well. 


## Visualising

You know what this post needs: graphs. Here we plot the median and
maximum time the benchmarking tool reports. 

```julia
using Plots
nms = ["Map", "Loop", "Generator", "Broadcast"]
bmList = [mapBM, loopBM ,genBM, broadBM]

timeArray = mapreduce(x -> [minimum(x).time, median(x).time, maximum(x).time], hcat, bmList)'
bar(nms, log.(timeArray[:, 2]), seriestype=:scatter, labels="Median", yaxis=("log Time"))
plot!(nms, log.(timeArray[:, 3]), seriestype=:scatter, labels="Maximum")
```

![Log running times](/assets/maploop/output_16_0.svg)

```julia
bar(nms[2:4], (timeArray[2:4, 2]), seriestype=:scatter, yaxis=("Time"), label="Median")
```

We have to plot the $$\log$$ of the running times as the naive `map`
is that much slower. The other methods are all about the same though,
so lets remove the `map` and focus on the fast methods. 

<!---
![Running times](/assets/maploop/output_17_0.svg)
--->

![Median running times](/assets/maploop/output_18_0.svg)

Here we can see that the loop method is still the fastest. The methods
provided in the feedback improve on the naive `map` but still cannot
compete with the loop. Using the `@simd` and `@inbounds` macro don't change the overall median
value for it to be worth the potential danger.



Overall there are lots of ways to accomplish this task, but the loop
still comes out on top. Even using the "go-faster" macros doesn't
improve on the runtime significantly.
