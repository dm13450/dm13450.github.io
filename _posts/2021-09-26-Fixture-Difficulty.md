How do we quantify the difficulty of a soccer match and can we
construct a single number that will explain how easy or hard the match
is for a team to win? I think we
can approach this by looking at the match odds and coming up with a
way to measure the imbalance. If one team is a dead certain favourite to win, then that
match should be easy for them and difficult for their opponent. If the
odds are similar for either team, then the match is balanced and their
is no apparent difficulty for either side.

## Kullback–Leibler Divergence

The
[Kullback-Leibler divergence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kullback%E2%80%93Leibler_divergence)
is a fancy method of comparing how two probability distributions are
different. It has a vast array of applications and can be used in lots
of different contexts, from time series analysis to machine learning
model fitting. In our case we are using it to compare the
match outcome probability distribution to a reference distribution.  

For each match there is a probability distribution,
$$p_\text{win}, p_\text{draw}, p_\text{lose}$$ which we can derive from
the match odds. 
What we want to know is how far away is this probability distribution
from a uniform distribution, where each outcome has an equal chance.
Kullback-Leibler Divergence (KL Divergence) does this calculation and
summarises how the probability distribution $$p$$ is different from
the probability distribution $$q$$ and is calculated as

$$\text{K} = \sum _i p_i \log \frac{p_i}{q_i},$$

where $$p_i$$ and $$q_i$$ are the probabilities in question for each
outcome. Our match
probability distribution ($$p$$) will be calculated from the odds of the match,
the reference distribution ($$q$$) will be 1/3 for each outcome. This
will give us one number that describes how different the match
outcomes are from the uniform distribution. 

Right enough maths. Onto the data.

Once again we turn to [www.football-data.co.uk](https://www.football-data.co.uk) to download the
results from many leagues across the years. We then convert the Pinnacle
closing odds into probabilities $$\left( p ^{\text{raw}} =
\frac{1}{\text{Decimal Odds}} \right)$$ using the standard normalisation
procedure

$$p_i = \frac{p_i ^\text{raw}}{\sum _i p ^ \text{raw} _i}.$$

Once that is done, we can calculate the KL divergence for
each match with our reference uniform
distribution across the three outcomes.

Here is the distribution of the KL divergence values across the
dataset. Most values are concentrated around 0 with a long
decay out to the larger values.

* Competitive matches have a KL divergence $$\rightarrow 0$$ as each
of the outcomes has an equal chance to happen.
* One sided matches have a KL divergence $$\rightarrow 1$$ as there is
  a clear favourite that is likely to win. The match outcome odds are
  unbalanced. 

To hammer the point home: a KL divergence of 0 indicates that the match outcome was
close to even, i.e. 1/3 chance home team win, 1/3 chance away team win,
1/3 chance draw. A KL divergence approaching 1  indicates that one
team had a much higher chance than the other of winning the match.

To add some context I've pulled out the largest and smallest KL values
to see what matches they represented. 

| Date       | HomeTeam  | AwayTeam | PSCH |  PSCD |  PSCA | KL |
|:-----------|:----------|:---------|-----:|------:|------:|------:|
| 2014-03-02 | Barcelona | Almeria  | 1.05 | 22.50 | 51.00 | 0.82 |
| 2018-01-28 | Leganes   | Espanol  | 2.91 |  2.93 |  2.94 | 0.00|

Barcelona vs Almeria is the easiest match in the database with the
largest KL value of 0.82 as Barcelona were the clear favourites
at 1.05. On the other
side of the coin Leganes vs Espanol in 2018 was the most evenly
matched where each outcome was equal and a KL divergence of 0 (rounded
to two decimal places). In this match, each of the outcomes had very
similar odds. Also, funny to note how both matches involved Spanish
teams. 

## From a KL Divergence to a Match Difficulty

The KL divergence value shows how unbalanced a match was, but to
convert it into a difficulty metric we need to understand who the
better team is in the match, our more typically put, the favourite. Again, we can simply use the odds and
multiply the KL divergence by 1 or -1 depending on whether the team is
the favourite or the underdog. 

So the full calculation steps are as follows:

1. Calculate the probability of each match outcome using the match
odds.
2. Calculate the KL divergence, $$K$$, of this distribution compared to a
uniform distribution.
3. For the match favourite (likely winner) the match difficulty is
$$K$$.
4. For the other team the match difficulty is -$$K$$. 


## Fixture Difficulty Per Team

Each team now has a difficulty rating for each of the matches it has
played in the database. We can go through each team, calculate a
rolling average to smooth the data out and see how each team's
difficulty rating has changed over time.

Dominant teams are going to have a difficulty rating greater than
zero, reflecting how they are usually favourites going into each
match, whereas weaker teams, will have a negative average
difficulty. If a team can sustain a high difficulty measure, then this
indicates they are performing well.

Each colour here represents a different season and I've added on a
general trend line in black. 

Difficulty gives a good indication of a teams ‘dominance’ and condenses
everything down into one number that seems to pass the eye test in
terms of a teams fortunes. Liverpool have fallen off
since their Champions League/title winning seasons. West Ham are going
through one of their best periods since (these) records have
began. Real Madrid and Barcelona have both come down slightly since
their periods of dominance. 

## League Difficulty

We can also assess the overall league difficulty by calculating the
average over a season per league, making sure we only count each match once.

![](/assets/FixtureDifficulty_files/figure-gfm/unnamed-chunk-10-1.png)

Here we can see Serie A (I1) has the most average difficulty game, whereas
Ligue 1 (F1) is the least, which is surprising considering the
dominance of PSG. The Premier League (E0) is nicely in the middle. More
interesting La Liga (SP1) had been the most difficulty up until 16/17 when is
has since balanced out more, perhaps highlighting how the main dominance
of Real Madrid and Barcelona has fallen off recently compared the
start of the decade.

So we’ve shown that there have been some interesting trends in
difficulty across both teams and seasons, but the bigger question is,
does is have any predictive power?

## Using Match Difficulty to Predict Things

To start with, I'll predict the outcome of the match using the
difficulty and the odds of the match. We’ve compressed the odds into
one number with the difficulty and now want to map this number
back to a probability of winning. I'll use the `nnet` package to build
a multinomial neural net, which is just a single-hidden-layer network,
so nothing too fancy.

I fit three models, one with just the odds, one with the difficulty
only and one with both odds and the difficulty. Each of the three
models also has a variable for the division that the match was played
in with all two way interactions. The result is a factor (-1 for a
loss, 0 for a draw and 1 for a win). 

```r
require(nnet)

oddsOnly <- multinom(Result ~ (Div + WinProb + DrawProb + LoseProb) ^ 2, 
                                      data=trainData)

oddsAndDifficulty <- multinom(Result ~ (Div + Difficulty + WinProb + DrawProb + LoseProb) ^ 2, 
                        data=trainData)

difficultyOnly <- multinom(Result ~ (Div + Difficulty ) ^2 , 
                        data=trainData)
```

The models are trained on all matches before 2020 and tested on all
models after 2020. 

| Accuracy | Kappa | Model               |
|---------:|------:|:--------------------|
|    0.496 | 0.211 | Odds and Difficulty |
|    0.496 | 0.210 | Odds Only           |
|    0.496 | 0.208 | Difficulty Only     |

So not much difference between the models in terms of accuracy or the
Cohen's $$\kappa$$ value so I think we can
conclude the difficulty of a match doesn't really add anything.
The match difficulty is a second order effect compared to the match
outcome probabilities, so unlikely to really improve model
performance, its adding minimal amount of information.

## Goals and Difficulty

So not much luck in helping predict the outcome of the match, but what
about the number of goals in a match?

We are going to model both the goals scored by a team using a Poisson
regression model. I'll just be using the difficulty of the match to
predict the number of goals scored, but will use a GAM and a GLM to
see if there is a nonlinear dependence. I've thrown a null model in
there as well, just to make sure the difficulty measure is adding some
predictive power.

```r
require(mgcv)
goalsScored_glm <- glm(GoalsScored ~ Difficulty, 
family = "poisson", data=trainData)

goalsScored_gam <- gam(GoalsScored ~ s(Difficulty), 
familty = "poisson", data=trainData)

goalsScored_null <- nullModel(y=trainData$GoalsScored)
```

Again, trained on all matches before 2020 and evaluated on all matches
after 2020. 

|  RMSE | Rsquared |   MAE | Model |
|------:|---------:|------:|:------|
| 1.122 |    0.112 | 0.887 | GAM   |
| 1.129 |    0.101 | 0.901 | GLM   |
| 1.191 |       NA | 0.961 | Null  |

I evaluate all three models on the held out test set and find that
the GAM is the best fitting model across all three metrics. Reduction
in the error measures and an increase in the $$R^2$$ value. Both
models also improve on the null model, so it looks like we are
actually onto something with this measure. 

Lets plot some graphs and see what the relationship between goals scored
and difficulty and how the GLM and GAM differ. 

To summarise the data, we round the difficulty to two decimal places and
calculate the average goals scored for that difficulty measure.


![](/assets/FixtureDifficulty_files/figure-gfm/unnamed-chunk-18-1.png)

Both models capture the underlying behaviour, but there are extra
nonlinear effects that the GAM is able to learn, which gives is the edge
over the GLM. For small difficulty values we can see the GLM
underestimates. Overall, gives us a good indication that difficulty
leads to a change in the number of goals scored and thus through
symmetry goals conceded.

## Shots and Shots on Target

How does difficulty effect other features of a match? We can repeat
the above modeling approach but switching out the dependent variable
from goals to shots and shots on target. We stick with a Poisson based
model, which is a bit of a large assumption to make as shots and shots
on target don't really follow a Poisson distribution, but for now it
will do.

|   RMSE | Rsquared |    MAE | Model       |
|-------:|---------:|-------:|:------------|
| 10.518 |    0.110 | 10.324 | Shots       |
|  3.346 |    0.111 |  3.124 | TargetShots |
|  1.122 |    0.112 |  0.887 | Goals       |

All three outputs have a similar $$R^2$$ which is what we would expect
really as goals, shots and shots on target are all correlated
with each other, so difficulty is going to be good at describing them
all. We can't compare the error metrics (MAE, RMSE) across the models, as they are all
distributed differently, there is more shots compared to shots on
target and also the variation is also larger.

When we plot the nonlinear effect of the difficulty in a match we can
see that the shapes are very similar across the three metrics, with
goals having a larger variation.

![](/assets/FixtureDifficulty_files/figure-gfm/unnamed-chunk-22-1.png)

Again, looking at the relationship we can see that goals has the most
variation with respect to difficulty. Shots and shots on target are very
similar. Similar shapes though, so we can assume that easier
matches (difficulty > 0) allow you to generate more shots and shots on target which
eventually lead to goals. 

## Conclusion

Hopefully I’ve convinced you that measuring the KL divergence between
the odds gives a good approximation to the difficulty of that fixture.
Teams that have easier fixtures tend to score more goals and have more
shots, both normal and those on target. This lines up with what we would
think would happen in an easier match so I think we can conclude all is
well.

In my next post I’ll use this difficulty measure in the Fantasy
Premier League setting to see if players score more points in easier
or hard matches.

## Environment and Footnotes

A bit like shownotes, I'll describe here how I've plotted the graphs.
Unsurprisingly, they've all been built in `ggplot2` with the `ipsum`
theme from the `hrbrthemes` package. In terms of colours, it was trial
and error on the <https://colorbrewer2.org> website and after choosing
a palette using `scale_colour_brewer` function.

The models were fitted using `nnet` (for the outcome model) and `mgcv`
for the all the GAMs. Nothing fancy.

You can download a notebook that contains all the code here:

You'll have to download the football data yourself, but then the above
can be run.
