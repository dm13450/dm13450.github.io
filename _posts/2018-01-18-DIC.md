Deviation information criteria (DIC) is a metric used to compare
Bayesian models. It is closely related to the Akaike
information criteria (AIC) which is defined as $$2k - 2 \ln
\hat{\mathcal{L}}$$, where *k* is the number of parameters in a model
and $$\hat{\mathcal{L}}$$ is the maximised log-likelihood. The DIC
makes some changes to this formula. Firstly by replacing a maximised
log-likelihood with the log-likelihood evaluated at the Bayes estimate
$$\hat{\theta}$$ and by replacing $$k$$ with an alternative correction

$$\begin{aligned}
\text{DIC} & = -2  \log p(y \mid \hat{\theta}) + 2 p _{\text{DIC}} ,\\
p_{\text{DIC}} & = 2 \left( \log p(y \mid \hat{\theta}) - \mathbb{E}
_{\text{post}} \log p(y \mid \theta) \right).
\end{aligned}$$

These changes make it more suitable for a Bayesian model, but beware,
it isn't a fully Bayesian metric in the philosophical sense. You are
reducing probability distributions down to point estimates, so it
looses some of the Bayesian credibility. It's also DIC and not DIC
criteria as that would be an example of [RAS syndrome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RAS_syndrome).

## A DIC Example

To demonstrate how we can calculate DIC, I simulate some data and
draw from its posterior distribution. For simplicity, I use the
Poisson distribution with a conjugate gamma distribution. This lets me
easily draw from the posterior distribution.

{% highlight r %}
y <- rpois(100, 10)

postDraws <- rgamma(1000, 0.01 + sum(y), 0.01 + length(y))

thetaBayes <- mean(postDraws)

logLikelihood <- function(theta) sum(dpois(y, theta, log=T))

pDIC <- 2*(logLikelihood(thetaBayes) - mean(sapply(postDraws, logLikelihood) ))
dic <- -2*logLikelihood(thetaBayes) + 2*pDIC
{% endhighlight %}

This gives us a DIC value of $$\sim 513$$. Which is useless on its
own, but given two models we can compare the DIC values and favour the
model with lowest DIC. 

## Model Comparison with DIC

To demonstrate this, we simulate some data from a gamma distribution
and fit two models; a gamma and a lognormal model using [Stan](http://mc-stan.org/). 

The Stan code for the models is simply:

{% highlight r %}
data {
	int N;
	real y[N];
}

parameters {
	real<lower=0> a;
	real<lower=0> b;
}

model {
	y ~ gamma(a, b);
}
{% endhighlight %}

Replacing the gamma distribution for a lognormal in the other model. 

I simulate 1000 datapoints and sample from Stan before forming a 2
column matrix with of the posterior samples. 

{% highlight r %}
y <- rgamma(1000, 2, 4)

gammaModel <- stan_model("dic_gamma.stan")
lognormalModel <- stan_model("dic_lognormal.stan")

gammaSamples <- sampling(gammaModel, list(y=y, N=length(y)))
lognormalSamples <- sampling(lognormalModel, list(y=y, N=length(y)))

postSamplesGamma <- Reduce(cbind, extract(gammaSamples, pars=c("a", "b")))
postSampleslognormal <- Reduce(cbind, extract(lognormalSamples, pars=c("mu", "sigma")))
{% endhighlight %}

To construct a function for the DIC score, you need to be able to pass in
the data, likelihood function and posterior samples. Thankfully, R has
a fairly standard way of using its probability distributions, we can
rely on both `dgamma` and `dlnorm` to take in the same type of
arguments. But the `dic` function is
not flexible enough that any distribution can be passed through. 

{% highlight r %}
dic <- function(data, likelihood, postSamples){
  
  logLikelihood <- function(theta) sum(likelihood(data, theta[1], theta[2], log=T))
  
  thetaBayes <- colMeans(postSamples)
  
  pDIC <- 2*(logLikelihood(thetaBayes) - mean(apply(postSamples, 1, logLikelihood) ))
  dic <- -2*logLikelihood(thetaBayes) + 2*pDIC
  
  return(dic)
}
{% endhighlight %}


{% highlight r %}
gammaDIC <- dic(y, dgamma, postSamplesGamma)
lognormalDIC <- dic(y, dlnorm, postSampleslognormal)
{% endhighlight %}

By applying the function to the sample data and calculating the values
we find that


| Model | DIC |
| -----|-----|
| Gamma |375.2491 |
| Lognormal | 478.6547 |

The true model (gamma) has the lower DIC as expected. So everything is
working as expected! 

You can also asses the DIC on some out-of-sample data. This is achieved
by simply simulating from the same distribution and passing it through
the `dic` function. 

{% highlight r %}
gammaDICOut <- dic(rgamma(100, 2, 4), dgamma, postSamplesGamma)
lognormalDICOut <- dic(rgamma(100, 2, 4), dlnorm, postSampleslognormal)
{% endhighlight %}


| Model | DIC |
| -----|-----|
| Gamma |12.42242 |
| Lognormal | 30.78499 |


Again, the gamma model has the lower DIC, more evidence that this is
the correct model. 

Overall, the DIC is a useful metric to asses your model correctness
and easy to calculate using your posterior samples.
