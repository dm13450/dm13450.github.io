Volatility measures the scales of price changes and is an easy way to
describe how busy markets are. High volatility means there are periods
of large price changes and vice versa, low volatility means periods of
small changes. In this post, I'll show you how to calculate realised (realized)
volatility and demonstrate how it can be used. If you just want a live
view of crypto volatility, take a look at
[cryptoliquiditymetrics](https://cryptoliquiditymetrics.com/) where I have added in a new card with the volatility over the last 24 hours.

To start with we will be looking at daily data. Using my
[CoinbasePro.jl](https://github.com/dm13450/CoinbasePro.jl) package in a Julia we can get the last 300 days OHLC
prices.

I'm running Julia 1.7 and all the packages were updated using
`Pkg.update()` at the time of this post. 

```julia
using CoinbasePro
using Dates
using Plots, StatsPlots
using DataFrames, DataFramesMeta
using RollingFunctions
```

From my [CoinbasePro.jl](https://github.com/dm13450/CoinbasePro.jl)
package, we can pull in the daily candles of Bitcoin. 86400 is the
frequency for daily data. Coinbase restrict you to just 300 data
points so our period of time will be the previous 300 days. 

```julia
dailydata = CoinbasePro.candles("BTC-USD", now()-Day(300), now(), 86400);
sort!(dailydata, :time)
dailydata = @transform(dailydata, :time = Date.(:time))
first(dailydata, 4)
```

<div class="data-frame"><p>4 rows × 7 columns</p><table class="data-frame"><thead><tr><th></th><th>close</th><th>high</th><th>low</th><th>open</th><th>unix_time</th><th>volume</th><th>time</th></tr><tr><th></th><th title="Float64">Float64</th><th title="Float64">Float64</th><th title="Float64">Float64</th><th title="Float64">Float64</th><th title="Int64">Int64</th><th title="Float64">Float64</th><th title="Date">Date</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><th>1</th><td>50978.6</td><td>51459.0</td><td>48909.8</td><td>48909.8</td><td>1615075200</td><td>13965.2</td><td>2021-03-07</td></tr><tr><th>2</th><td>52415.2</td><td>52425.0</td><td>49328.6</td><td>50976.2</td><td>1615161600</td><td>18856.3</td><td>2021-03-08</td></tr><tr><th>3</th><td>54916.4</td><td>54936.0</td><td>51845.0</td><td>52413.2</td><td>1615248000</td><td>21177.1</td><td>2021-03-09</td></tr><tr><th>4</th><td>55890.7</td><td>57402.1</td><td>53025.0</td><td>54921.6</td><td>1615334400</td><td>28326.1</td><td>2021-03-10</td></tr></tbody></table></div>


Plotting this gives you the typical price path of daily closing prices. Now realised
volatility is a measure of how varied this price was
over time. Was it stable or were there wild swings?

```julia
plot(dailydata.time, dailydata.close, label = :none, 
     ylabel = "Price", title = "Bitcoin Price", titleloc = :left, linewidth = 2)
```
	 
![Bitcoin Daily Prices](/assets/volmethods/output_3_0.svg "Bitcoin
 Daily Prices")


To calculate this variation, we need to add in the log-returns. 

```julia
dailydata = @transform(dailydata, :returns = [NaN; diff(log.(:close))]);
bar(dailydata.time[2:end], dailydata.returns[2:end], 
    label=:none, 
    ylabel = "Log Return", title = "Bitcoin Log Return", titleloc = :left)
```

![Bitcoin Daily Log Returns](/assets/volmethods/output_6_0.svg "Bitcoin Daily Log Returns")


We can start by looking at this from a distribution perspective. If we
assume the log-returns ($$r$$) are from a normal distribution, with
zero mean, the standard deviation of this distribution is the equivalent to the
volatility

$$r \sim N(0, \sigma ^2),$$

so $$\sigma$$ is how we will refer to volatility. From this, you can
see how high volatility leads to wide variations in prices. Each
log-return sample has a wider range of values that it could be.


So by taking the running standard deviation of the log-returns we can
estimate the volatility and how it changes over time. Using the `RollingFunctions.jl` package this is a one-liner.


```julia
dailydata = @transform(dailydata, :volatility = runstd(:returns, 30))
plot(dailydata.time, dailydata.volatility, title = "Bitcoin Volatility", titleloc = :left, label=:none, linewidth = 2)
```

![Bitcoin Daily Volatility](/assets/volmethods/output_9_0.svg
 "Bitcoin Daily Volatility")


There was high volatility over June this year as the price of Bitcoin
crashed. It's been fairly stable since then, hovering around 0.03
and 0.04. How does this compare though to the S&P 500 as a general
indicator of the stop market? We know Bitcoin is more volatile than
the stock market, but how much more?

I'll load up the [AlphaVantage.jl](https://github.com/ellisvalentiner/AlphaVantage.jl) package to pull the daily prices of
the SPY ETF and repeat the calculation; adding the log-returns and
taking the rolling standard deviation. 


```julia
using AlphaVantage, CSV

stockPrices = AlphaVantage.time_series_daily("SPY", datatype="csv", outputsize="full", parser = x -> CSV.File(IOBuffer(x.body))) |> DataFrame
sort!(stockPrices, :timestamp)
stockPrices = @subset(stockPrices, :timestamp .>= minimum(dailydata.time));
```

Again, add in the log-returns and calculate the rolling standard
deviation to estimate the volatility. 

```julia
stockPrices = @transform(stockPrices, :returns = [NaN; diff(log.(:close))])
stockPrices = @transform(stockPrices, :volatility = runstd(:returns, 30));

volPlot = plot(dailydata.time, dailydata.volatility, label="BTC", 
               ylabel = "Volatility", title = "Volatility", titleloc = :left, linewidth = 2)
volPlot = plot!(volPlot, stockPrices.timestamp, stockPrices.volatility, label = "SPY", linewidth = 2)
```


![Bitcoin and SPY volatility](/assets/volmethods/output_15_0.svg "Bitcoin and SPY volatility")

As expected, Bitcoin volatility is much higher. Let's take the log of
the volatility to look zoom in on the detail.

```julia
volPlot = plot(dailydata.time, log.(dailydata.volatility), 
               label="BTC", ylabel = "Log Volatility", title = "Log Volatility", 
               titleloc = :left, linewidth = 2)
volPlot = plot!(volPlot, stockPrices.timestamp, log.(stockPrices.volatility), label = "SPY", linewidth = 2)
```

![Bitcoin and SPY Log Volatility](/assets/volmethods/output_17_0.svg
 "Bitcoin and SPY log volatility")

Interestingly the SPY has had a resurgence in volatility as we move
towards the end of the year. One thing to point out though is the
slight difference in look back periods for the two products. Bitcoin
does not observe weekends or holidays, so 30 rows previously are
always 30 days, but for SPY this is the case as there are weekends and
trading holidays. In this illustrative example, it isn't too much of an
issue, but if you were to take it further and perhaps look at the
correlation between the volatilities, this is something you would need
to account for.
	
##  A Higher Frequency Volatility

So far it has all been on daily observations, your classic dataset to
practise on. But I am always banging on about [high-frequency finance](https://dm13450.github.io/2021/06/25/HighFreqCrypto.html),
so let's look at more frequent data and understand how the volatility
looks at finer timescales.

This time we will pull the 5-minute candle bar data of both Bitcoin
and SPY and repeat the calculation.

1. Calculate the log-returns of the close to close bars
2. Calculate the rolling standard deviation by looking back 20 rows.

```julia
minuteData_spy = AlphaVantage.time_series_intraday_extended("SPY", "5min", "year1month1", parser = x -> CSV.File(IOBuffer(x.body))) |> DataFrame
minuteData_spy = @transform(minuteData_spy, :time = DateTime.(:time, dateformat"yyyy-mm-dd HH:MM:SS"))
minuteData_btc = CoinbasePro.candles("BTC-USD", maximum(minuteData_spy.time)-Day(1), maximum(minuteData_spy.time),300);

combData = leftjoin(minuteData_spy[!, [:time, :close]], minuteData_btc[!, [:time, :close]], on=[:time], makeunique=true)
rename!(combData, ["time", "spy", "btc"])
combData = combData[2:end, :]
dropmissing!(combData)
sort!(combData, :time)
first(combData, 3)
```

<div class="data-frame"><p>3 rows × 3 columns</p><table class="data-frame"><thead><tr><th></th><th>time</th><th>spy</th><th>btc</th></tr><tr><th></th><th title="DateTime">DateTime</th><th title="Float64">Float64</th><th title="Float64">Float64</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><th>1</th><td>2021-12-29T20:00:00</td><td>477.05</td><td>47163.9</td></tr><tr><th>2</th><td>2021-12-30T04:05:00</td><td>477.83</td><td>46676.3</td></tr><tr><th>3</th><td>2021-12-30T04:10:00</td><td>477.98</td><td>46768.8</td></tr></tbody></table></div>



For 5 minute data, we will use a look-back period of 20 rows, which gives us 100 minutes, so a little under 2 hours. 


```julia
combData = @transform(combData, :spy_returns = [NaN; diff(log.(:spy))],
                                :btc_returns = [NaN; diff(log.(:btc))])
combData = @transform(combData, :spy_vol = runstd(:spy_returns, 20),
                                :btc_vol = runstd(:btc_returns, 20))
combData = combData[2:end, :];
```

Plotting it all again!

```julia
vol_tks = minimum(combData.time):Hour(6):maximum(combData.time)
vol_tkslbl = Dates.format.(vol_tks, "e HH:MM")

returnPlot = plot(combData.time[2:end], cumsum(combData.btc_returns[2:end]), 
                  label="BTC", title = "Cumulative Returns", xticks = (vol_tks, vol_tkslbl),
                  linewidth = 2, legend=:topleft)
returnPlot = plot!(returnPlot, combData.time[2:end], cumsum(combData.spy_returns[2:end]), label="SPY",
                   xticks = (vol_tks, vol_tkslbl),
                   linewidth = 2)


volPlot = plot(combData.time, combData.btc_vol * sqrt(24 * 20), 
    label="BTC", xticks = (vol_tks, vol_tkslbl), titleloc = :left, linewidth = 2)
volPlot = plot!(combData.time, combData.spy_vol * sqrt(24 * 20), label="SPY", title = "Volatility",
               xticks = (vol_tks, vol_tkslbl), titleloc = :left, linewidth = 2)

plot(returnPlot, volPlot)
```


![5 minute returns and volatility](/assets/volmethods/output_25_0.svg
 "5 minute returns and volatility")

On the left-hand side, we have the cumulative return of the two
assets on the 30th of December, and on the right the corresponding
volatility. Bitcoin still has higher volatility whereas SPY has been
relatively stable with just some jumps.

## Simplifying the Calculation

Rolling the standard deviation isn't the efficient way of calculating the volatility and can also be simplified down to a more efficient calculation. 

The standard deviation is defined as: 

$$\sigma ^2 = \mathbb{E} (r^2) + \mathbb{E} (r) ^2$$

if we assume there is no trend in the returns so that the average is zero: 

$$\mathbb{E} (r) = 0$$

then we get just the first term

$$\sigma ^2 = \frac{1}{N} \sum _{i=1} ^N r^2$$

which is simply proportional to the sum of squares. Hence why you will
hear that the realised variance is referred to as the sum of squares. 


Once again, let's pull the data and repeat the previous calculations
but this time adding another column that is the rolling summation of
the square of the returns. 

```julia
minutedata = CoinbasePro.candles("BTC-USD", now()-Day(1) - Hour(1), now(), 5*60)
sort!(minutedata, :time)
minutedata = @transform(minutedata, :close_close_return = [NaN; diff(log.(:close))])
minutedata = minutedata[2:end, :]
first(minutedata, 4)

minutedata = @transform(minutedata,
                                    :new_vol_5 = running(sum, :close_close_return .^2, 20),
                                    :vol_5 = runstd(:close_close_return, 20))
minutedata = minutedata[2:end, :]
minutedata[1:5, [:time, :new_vol_5, :vol_5]]
```




<div class="data-frame"><p>5 rows × 3 columns</p><table class="data-frame"><thead><tr><th></th><th>time</th><th>new_vol_5</th><th>vol_5</th></tr><tr><th></th><th title="DateTime">DateTime</th><th title="Float64">Float64</th><th title="Float64">Float64</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><th>1</th><td>2021-12-30T13:40:00</td><td>3.05319e-6</td><td>0.00171371</td></tr><tr><th>2</th><td>2021-12-30T13:45:00</td><td>5.11203e-6</td><td>0.00139403</td></tr><tr><th>3</th><td>2021-12-30T13:50:00</td><td>5.11472e-6</td><td>0.00118951</td></tr><tr><th>4</th><td>2021-12-30T13:55:00</td><td>6.40417e-6</td><td>0.00107273</td></tr><tr><th>5</th><td>2021-12-30T14:00:00</td><td>6.55196e-6</td><td>0.00104028</td></tr></tbody></table></div>




```julia
vol_tks = minimum(minutedata.time):Hour(8):maximum(minutedata.time)
vol_tkslbl = Dates.format.(vol_tks, "e HH:MM")

ss_vol = plot(minutedata.time, sqrt.(288 * minutedata.new_vol_5), titleloc = :left, 
              title = "Sum of Squares", label=:none, xticks = (vol_tks, vol_tkslbl), linewidth = 2)
std_vol = plot(minutedata.time, sqrt.(288 * minutedata.vol_5), titleloc = :left, 
               title = "Standard Deviation", label=:none, xticks = (vol_tks, vol_tkslbl), linewidth = 2)
plot(ss_vol, std_vol)
```




![Standard deviation vs sum of squares for volatility](/assets/volmethods/output_30_0.svg
 "Standard deviation vs sum of squares for volatility")


Both methods show represent the relative changes equally. There are
some notable edge effects in the standard deviation method, but
overall, our assumptions look fine. The y-scales are different though
as there are some constant factor differences between the two methods.

## Comparing Crypto Volatilities

Let's see how the volatility changes across some different
currencies. We define a function that calculates the close to close
return and iterate through some different currencies. 


```julia
function calc_vol(ccy)
    minutedata = CoinbasePro.candles(ccy, now()-Day(1) - Hour(1), now(), 5*60)
    sort!(minutedata, :time)
    minutedata = @transform(minutedata, :close_close_return = [NaN; diff(log.(:close))])
    minutedata = minutedata[2:end, :]
    minutedata = @transform(minutedata, :var = 288*running(sum, :close_close_return .^2, 20))
    minutedata
    minutedata[21:end, :]
end
```

Let's choose the classics BTC and ETH, the meme that is SHIB and
finally EURUSD (the crypto version).  

```julia
p = plot(legend=:topleft, ylabel = "Realised Volatility")
for ccy in ["BTC-USD", "ETH-USD", "USDC-EUR", "SHIB-USD"]
    voldata = calc_vol(ccy)
    vol_tks = minimum(voldata.time):Hour(4):maximum(voldata.time)
    vol_tkslbl = Dates.format.(vol_tks, "e HH:MM")
    plot!(voldata.time, sqrt.(voldata.var), label = ccy, 
          xticks = (vol_tks, vol_tkslbl), linewidth = 2)
end
p
```

![Volatility comparison between different currencies.](/assets/volmethods/output_34_0.svg "Volatility Comparisons")

SHIB has higher overall volatility. ETH and BTC have very comparable
volatilities moving together. EURUSD has the lowest overall (as we
would expect), but interesting to see how it moved higher just as the
cryptos did at about 9 am.


##  An Update to CryptoLiquidityMetrics

So I've taken everything we've learnt here and implemented it into
[cryptoliquiditymetrics.com](https://cryptoliquiditymetrics.com/). It is a new panel (bottom right) and
calculated all through Javascript. 

![Screenshot of cryptoliquiditymetrics.com](/assets/volmethods/cryptoliquiditymetrics.png  "Cryptoliquidtymetrics screenshot")

How does this help you?

Knowing the volatility helps you get an idea of how easy it is to trade
or what strategy to use. When volatility is high and the price is
moving about it might be better to be more aggressive and make sure your trade
happens. Whereas if it is a stable market without too much volatility
you could be more passive and just wait, trading slowly and picking
good prices. 

Just another addition to my Javascript side project!
