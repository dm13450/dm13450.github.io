For those that don't know Taskmaster is a game show where 5 comedians
compete in a variety of nonsensical tasks to win points from the
Taskmaster. Most of the time the tasks are
creative, (draw a horse while riding a horse) or time-based (burst all
the bubbles on some bubble wrap in the shortest time). Still not sure
what it is about? Watch some highlights on their Youtube
channel [here](https://www.youtube.com/c/Taskmaster/featured) (hopefully,
it works in your country).

It is my Thursday night ritual to settle down and watch this show and
in a recent episode the final task set up an interesting problem that had
some elements of game theory and randomness. It went as follows:


>There are 100 balloons. 5 of the balloons are 'bad'. You can throw
>between 1 and 10 darts to burst a balloon. If you burst one of the bad
>balloons you are eliminated. There are 5 contestants in total, if you
>are first eliminated you score 1 point, second eliminated 2 points,
>third eliminated 3 points, fourth eliminated then 4 points, and finally
>the winner scores 10 points.

I'll walk you through how I simulated this task in
Python, examined the different strategies and what the optimal
strategy turned out to be. I'll finally pose
some open questions on where to take this next.

This is a task with some game theory, probability, and randomness, the type of
thing that gets my grey matter active. Plus, one of the contestants
(Victoria Coren Mitchel) is a professional poker player, so I wonder if
she also had an idea on the best way to approach the task. If you only
know VCM from Only Connect or being married to David Mitchell, read
her

as it details her professional poker career. 

How should you approach this balloon popping task? I hypothesised
that early on in the game you want to throw as many darts as possible
to try and force everyone else to hit one of the bad balloons. I picked
up the pen and paper, tried to derive the probability distribution,
gave up, and decided to play to my strengths. Which is applying some brute force with
some computation.

Let's start with setting up the right packages. All should be self-explanatory.

```python
import random
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
import seaborn as sns
sns.set_theme()
```

Now to get an idea of how to program this task we want to do the following.

1. Draw 5 numbers from 1 to 100 without replacement. These represent the 'bad balloon' that will eliminate players.
2. Draw all the numbers from 1 to 100 without replacement. This represents what order the balloons are popped.
3. Find the index when the bad balloons are popped.

```python
def simulate(balloons, bad):
    bad_balloons = random.sample(range(balloons), bad)
    throws = random.sample(range(balloons), balloons)
    pops = [throws.index(x) for x in bad_balloons]
    pops.sort()
    return np.asarray(pops)
```

We can then run this 10,000 times and work out the average number if
darts until each balloon is burst.

```python
res = np.matrix([simulate(100, 5) for x in range(10000)])
res.sum(axis=0) / 10000
```

```
matrix([[15.8373, 32.7258, 49.4414, 66.3377, 83.1278]])
```

So, between 15 and 16 darts until the first balloon is popped, 33 until
the second balloon (etc for the other balloons). So we can simulate
the basic structure of the game, let's now look at strategies.

## Popping Strategies

We have a choice to throw $$N$$ darts where $$1 \leq N \leq 10$$. We
can explore a null strategy, a constant strategy, and a 'smart'
strategy.

* **Null Strategy**: Every time it is our turn, throw a random amount of
darts.
* **Fixed Strategy**: Chose $$M$$ darts, only ever throw this amount of
darts.
* **'Smart Strategy'**: Adjust the number of darts you will throw based on
whats happened in the game so far. 

For each strategy, we will simulate the game multiple times and
calculate the average points won to see how good it is. 

### Simulating the Task

We are now simulating the full game, so we need to take the `simulate`
function and slightly adjust it to account for the other players.

Whilst there are still balloons to be popped we go through each player
and obtain the number of darts they want to through and then check to see if
they hit a bad balloon. If they do hit a bad balloon, they are given a
result and no longer participate. If all the balloons are popped the
game finishes. For each game, we randomise the starting order of the players. 

```python
def run_game(throw_function):
    bad_balloons = random.sample(range(100), 5)
    bad_balloons.sort()
    players = list(range(5))
    burst = 0
    total_throws = 0
    result = [0 for x in players]
    random.shuffle(players)

    rewards = [1, 2, 3, 4, 10]

    while burst <= len(bad_balloons):
        for player in players:
            throws = throw_function(player) if result[player] == 0 else 0
            total_throws += throws

            if total_throws >= bad_balloons[burst]:
                total_throws = bad_balloons[burst]
                result[player] = rewards[burst]
                burst += 1

            if burst >= len(bad_balloons):
                break
        if burst >= len(bad_balloons):
            break

    return(result)
```

For each of the listed strategies we want to create a `throw_function`
that we can pass into the `run_game` function that will play out that
game multiple times. We then calculate the average number of points
each player scores. We then refer to this as the *expected points* of
a strategy that someone would score if they played the task enough. 

### The Null Strategy

The null strategy is simple. We draw a random integer from between 1
and 10 to choose the number of darts to throw. Every player will follow
this strategy and act randomly. We call it the **null** strategy as it
doesn't require any decisions and is the simplest approach to the
game.

```python
def null_strategy(player):
    return random.sample(range(1, 10), 1)[0]
```

So to simulate this we pass the above function into our `run_game`
function.

```python
null_results = np.matrix([np.asarray(run_game(null_strategy)) for x in range(100000)])
null_results.sum(axis=0) / 100000
```

```
matrix([[4.00084, 3.98669, 4.01453, 3.98103, 4.01691]])
```

This takes about 10 seconds and we can see that all 5 players on
average earn about 4 points, the same as taking the average of all the
points that could be rewarded.

The fact that everyone has close to the same amount of points, and
these points are also close to the theoretical average reassures us
that the above code is correct and is simulating the task
properly. Always good to check these things!

### The Constant Strategy

Now, let's throw the same amount of darts per simulation. The other four
players will throw a random amount, it is just us that will throw a
fixed amount.

This time we are going to write a function that generates a function
that helps
keep the simulation code concise.

```python
def constant_strategy_generator(strat):
    def get_throws(player):
        if player == 0:
            return strat
        return random.sample(range(1, 10), 1)[0]
    return get_throws
```

We are player 0, so that's when we throw `strat` darts. As an example,
we can generate a 'throw 10' function and pass that to the game
simulation and simulate the game 10 times. 

```python
throw10 = constant_strategy_generator(10)

res10 = np.matrix([np.asarray(run_game(throw10)) for x in range(100)])
res10.sum(axis=0) / 100
```

```
matrix([[2.67, 4.14, 4.8 , 4.32, 4.07]])
```

Our average points won of 2.67 is worse than the null strategy and worse
than everyone else's. Not a great sign for the 'throw 10' strategy.

Let's run the simulation for all the values between 1 and 10 and pull
out the results of player 0 (us!). 

```python
constant_results = [np.matrix([np.asarray(run_game(constant_strategy_generator(throws))) for x in range(100000)])[:, 0] for throws in range(1, 11)]
```

This takes about a minute and a half to run, so nothing too strenuous
for my laptop. 

We are now going to convert this to a pandas dataframe to allow easy
plotting. 

```python
strat_results = np.concatenate(constant_results, axis=1)
strat_df = pd.DataFrame(strat_results, columns=[f'{throw}' for throw in range(1, 11)])
strat_df["Null"] = null_results[:, 0]
```
We've also added in the null result so can easily compare the
strategies. 

To plot the results we are going to use the `seaborn` package. This
allows us to summarise the results and calculate uncertainty in the
values automatically. In this case though, because of the large number
of simulations, you can't see the error bars.

```python
sns.catplot(data=strat_df, kind="point", join=False)
```

![](/assets/taskmaster/strat1.png)

A couple of key things to point out here:

* The null result is comparable to always throwing 5 darts.

When randomly throwing darts, on average you will throw 5 darts, so
again, this shows that our simulation is consistent.

* Throwing 1 dart is the best move.

With expected points of about 7.6, it's easily the best way to
maximise your point-scoring.

* Throwing any more than 5 darts is a negative expected value
strategy.

So my original hypothesis was wrong, you don't want to throw that
many darts. Quite the opposite, minimise the number of darts you
throw to score more points.

Now, can we vary the number of darts we throw in a smart way to arrive
at a superior strategy?

### An Intelligent Strategy

From the above, we know that you don't want to throw that many
darts, but, if we throw some more darts, reducing the number of
balloons, there is a higher probability the other players will burst
one of the bad balloons. When do we push our luck? When the probability
of bursting a balloon is the lowest, which is the first round of the
game (if you go first) or if you are next after a balloon bursts. So if
we count the number of balloons since the last bad balloon burst we can
pass that into our strategy and use it to decide how many to throw.

```python
def intelligent_strat(darts_since_burst):
return 2 if darts_since_burst == 0 else 1

def throw_function_intelligent(player, darts_since_burst):
    if player == 0:
        return intelligent_strat(darts_since_burst) 
    return random.sample(range(1, 10), 1)[0]
```

Annoyingly, we now have to rewrite our simulation code to account for
this extra variable we are passing in.

```python
def run_game_intelligent(throw_function):
    bad_balloons = random.sample(range(100), 5)
    bad_balloons.sort()
    players = list(range(5))
    burst = 0
    total_throws = 0
    darts_since_burst = 0
    result = [0 for x in players]
    random.shuffle(players)

    rewards = [1, 2, 3, 4, 10]
    while burst <= len(bad_balloons):
        for player in players:
 
            throws = throw_function(player, darts_since_burst) if result[player] == 0 else 0

            total_throws += throws
            darts_since_burst += throws
            
            if total_throws >= bad_balloons[burst]:
                total_throws = bad_balloons[burst]
                result[player] = rewards[burst]
                burst += 1
                darts_since_burst = 0

            if burst >= len(bad_balloons):
                break
        if burst >= len(bad_balloons):
            break

    return(result)
```

Very similar to the previous simulation code, but now we also count
the number of throws since the last bad balloon popped and pass that
into our strategy function.

Again, we simulate this and add it to our results dataframe. 

```python
res_intelligent = np.matrix([np.asarray(run_game_intelligent(throw_function_intelligent)) for x in range(100000)])
res_intelligent.sum(axis=0) / 100000

strat_df["Smart"] = res_intelligent[:, 0]
strat_plot = sns.catplot(data=strat_df[['1', '2', 'Null', 'Smart']],
                                      kind="point", 
                                      join=False, ci="sd")
```

This time instead of plotting the bootstrap errors we are plotting the
standard deviation of the results which gives us an idea of the
variance of the strategies. 

![](/assets/taskmaster/strat2.png)

Disappointingly, still doesn't improve on the constant 1 dart strategy,
both in terms of average points and also variance. The 1 dart strat
has a standard deviation of 3.42, whereas this smart strat has a
standard deviation of 3.53.

## Summary

For this Taskmaster task, your best bet is to throw one dart
at a time. Bit of a boring result, but aligns with Occam's razor, you
don't want to burst a balloon, so take part in the game as little as
possible by throwing the least amount of darts.

Now, we could try and learn the optimal function by representing the
strategy as a black box using a neural network, simulating through the
task, and learning the optimal policy. But I don't think there is much
of a chance of improving on the simple 1 dart strategy because
it is such a simple game. 

Now, if I've made any glaring errors, written something inefficiently
or you think you've come up with a better strategy, let me know in the
