I am a 4th year Theoretical Physics student at the University of Manchester finishing my final year of my MPhys degree. 


I have worked for an investment bank, pricing equity derivatives using C# and Excel. I have also worked for the NHS implementing a mobile working device, which involved educating the end users.
