I am a 4th year Theoretical Physics student at the University of Manchester finishing my final year of my MPhys degree. 

My interests include stochastic process and how they apply in the real world, general financial market interaction and machine learning. 

I have worked for an investment bank, pricing equity derivatives using C# and Excel. I have also worked for the NHS implementing a mobile working device, which involved educating the end users.
