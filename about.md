I've got a PhD in Statistical Science from University College London
(UCL) and my thesis was [Bayesian Nonparametric Hawkes Processes with Applications](https://discovery.ucl.ac.uk/id/eprint/10109374/). I also have an MRes in Computer Science and an MPhys in
Theoretical Physics from the University of Manchester. 

I run a dashboard for crypto liquidity and pre-trade analytics: <https://cryptoliquiditymetrics.com/>

I'm an open source contributor with multiple projects
ongoing: [dirichletprocess](https://github.com/dm13450/dirichletprocess),
[HawkesProcesses.jl](https://github.com/dm13450/HawkesProcesses.jl),

## My Day Job Now

I'm currently an electronic trading quant working on both principal
and algo execution. I build models, analyse data and construct
algorithms to try and get the best prices in the market with the
lowest impact. 

I was a quant at [BestX](https://www.bestx.co.uk/) and spent the day
researching financial markets with a focus on transaction cost
analysis (TCA).  This involved cleaning data, making graphs and trying
to come up with some (hopefully) interesting insights about the world
of FX, fixed income and equity trading.

Examples of my work can be found in the trade press:

* [What Happens When a Primary FX Venue Goes Offline?](https://thefullfx.com/what-happens-when-a-primary-fx-venue-goes-offline/) -
  3rd most read article of 2023 on Full FX. 
* [FX Markets Remained Orderly During Recent Interventions](https://thefullfx.com/fx-markets-remained-orderly-during-recent-interventions-bofa/)
* [To Cross or Not to Cross](https://www.profit-loss.com/to-cross-or-not-to-cross)
* [Choppy markets revive quest for RFQs magic number](https://www.fx-markets.com/trading/7550661/choppy-markets-revive-quest-for-rfqs-magic-number)
* [Volatile FX markets reveal pitfalls of RFQ](https://www.fx-markets.com/infrastructure/7539591/volatile-fx-markets-reveal-pitfalls-of-rfq)
* [Price limits in FX algos: fill your boots](https://www.fx-markets.com/tech-and-data/4336451/price-limits-in-fx-algos-fill-your-boots)

Some of which are behind a paywall. 

## Outside the Day Job

I also have a keen interest in sports modelling and how statistics can
be used in professional sports and gambling, I enjoy a good film,
watching a boxset too quickly and a bit of a foodie. Here I am enjoying some delicious Korean BBQ.
