I am a newly started graduate student at University College London and a member of the Financial Computing Training Programme. This means that I am currently studying for an Masters in Research (MRes) in Computer Science and will be starting a PhD programme in statistics in 2016. Previously, I completed an MPhys in Theoretical Physics at the University of Manchester. 

I have worked in the finance industry at large investment bank as part of an equity derivatives team that engineered software to price a large range of  securites. I have also worked at a smaller firm as a intern trading emerging market products in both european and american markets.
