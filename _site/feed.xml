        <description>&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On Friday the 25th of September I took myself along to King’s College to attend the London-Paris Bachelier Workshop on Mathematical Finance . It was a two day event designed to highlight the collaboration between London and Parisian universities in the maths and finance field. As a new graduate student of the finance field I thought it was a good opportunity to attend.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whilst there were many interesting topics, the stand out talk for me was John Armstrong on stochastic filtering. By projecting a stochastic equation onto a manifold and choosing an appropriate metric an approximate solution can be found. The exact details are a bit beyond my grasp and I hope that I haven’t misinterpreted the overall aim of the talk. I hope that in the future I can look back on this and re-write it with a better understanding!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overall, the workshop was an excellent introduction to what to expect as a grad student and I look forward to attending more.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Inhomogenous Poisson Process</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;My first forray into statistics and finance begins with the simulation, fitting and checking of the inhomogenous poisson process.
THe inhomogenous poisson process is easily defined, instead of constant rate $\lambda$ as per the usual Poisson process, the rate can now varry in time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Simulating this is done using a method called thinning; a Poisson process is simulated with rate greater than the inhomogenous rate, with points being rejected, or “thinned” out to give the final inhomogenous process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Therefore the algorithm runs as follows: 
1. Generate a Poisson varaible with rate $\lambda ^&lt;em&gt;$ such that $\lambda ^&lt;/em&gt; &amp;gt; \lambda (t) \forall t$. Increment time by this variable. 
2. Calculate the ratio $\lambda (t) / \lambda ^*$ and compare this to a unifromally distributed variable. If the ratio is greater then accept the time else reject the time and continue with step one again. 
3. The accepted times are the correct times of the inhomogenous process.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Bulk Downloading from Turnitin using Python.</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;As a teaching assistant, occasionally I get assigned to marks a series of papers. This involves tediously searching for the students paper on the Turnitin app inside moodle before clicking a download button. When you’ve got 36 papers to download, this is far to much clicking and mouse movement. So I wrote a Python script to automate it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Firstly, I had to consider how the file was pulled from the server. Thankfully, it was a simple POST request with the paper id as one of the parameters. Using the FireFox addon Tamper, I was able to easily view and submit a custom post request. All it required was a session id and paper id.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Moving onto Python, I used the urllib2 package to open the custom POST url. Then it was a case of writing the response to a pdf file. Extending this to 36 urls is as simple as looping through each line in a file.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Python-esque pseudo-code, this looks like:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;for&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;line&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;ow&quot;&gt;in&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;id_list&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;response&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;urllib2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;urlopen&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;base_url&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;+&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;sessionid&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;+&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;paperid&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;pdf_file&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;write&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;response&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;read&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;())&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;pdf_file&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;close&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The simplicity of the urllib2 is what makes this short script so easy to construct and use.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Future work would be to get the session id automatically rather than manually copying and pasting it in.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On an unrelated note, looks like I need to fix the code formatting above. I’ll save that for another day.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Films I&#39;ve Watched In January 2016</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Ordered as per my memory!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;V for Vendetta&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Cartel Land&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Howl&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Silence of The Lambs&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Sicario&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Star Wars 7&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Legend&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Mad Max: Fury Road&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Silence of the Lambs easily comes out top and I’ll be the millionth person to say that the acting and story is captivating. If you’ve not seen it, put it high on your list of things to watch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mad Max is the most over rated. Despite the various internet list raving about it the non-stop action and lack of real character development just didn’t click with me. The fact that they ended up turning around on the road just to go back again felt like a bit of a cop out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Legend was another underwhelming occurrence. I felt like it was trying to appeal to the separate male and female audiences in tandem and not really connecting with either. Whilst the technical effect of having Tom Hardy play both roles was interesting, it wasn’t enough to salvage the story. In the end it was the worst of both a love story and a gangster film.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Similarly, Sicario started off as a cop/military film before throwing that all out the window to become a revenge film. The first half is intense and lets you develop a real distrust of the authority figures, but this eventually fizzles out as the film moves onto the revenge part before ending with either questions for the audience to think about themselves but they actually feel like plot holes. Still, it peaked my interest in the Mexican Cartel story, hence I gave Cartel Land a watch. It’s an alright documentary, but less about the Cartels and more about the resistance against them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My only trip to the cinema in January was to beat the crowds and finally see the behemoth that is the new Star Wars. It does everything right but it doesn’t push any boundaries. The more I think of it, the more I realise that it is basically a HD remake of A New Hope. But still, I look forward to number 8 and see whether that is a bit more adventurous.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, Howl, your classic lower budget horror film. It ticks the boxes and provides enough core and creature shots to leave you feeling satisfied. Watch it as an appetiser to Dog Soldiers.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Introduction To Bayseian Inference</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;As you move into more complicated Bayesian problems things get more computationally inclined. For most cases, the posterior you arrive at cannot be calculated analytically. Therefore, once you have an expression for your posterior distribution, you need to sample from it to gain an understanding of how it looks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this post we will look at the most simple of cases: using Bayesian methods to estimate the mean and variance of data that has been obtained from a normal distribution.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-likelihood&quot;&gt;The Likelihood&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this simple example we know that the data is normally distributed &lt;script type=&quot;math/tex&quot;&gt;x_i \sim \mathcal{N} ( \mu , \sigma ^2)&lt;/script&gt;. We can define the unknown parameters as a vector &lt;script type=&quot;math/tex&quot;&gt;\boldsymbol{\theta} = (\mu, \sigma ^2)&lt;/script&gt;. The likelihood is obtained by multiplying the distribution together for each data point&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;script type=&quot;math/tex; mode=display&quot;&gt;\mathcal{L} = \prod _i \frac{1}{\sqrt{2 \pi \sigma ^2}} \exp \left( - \frac{(x_i - \mu)^2}{2 \sigma^2} \right),&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;script type=&quot;math/tex; mode=display&quot;&gt;\propto \frac{1}{\sigma ^n} \exp \left(- \frac{1}{2\sigma^2} \sum _i (x_i - \mu )^2 \right).&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This can be simplified using the sample variance and sample mean, but this unnessacry detail in this simple case.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-prior&quot;&gt;The Prior&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As there are two unknown parameters, our prior distribution is a joint distribution&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;script type=&quot;math/tex; mode=display&quot;&gt;p(\mu, \sigma ^2) = p(\mu) p (\sigma )&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(To be completed)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-posterior-and-metropolis-sampling&quot;&gt;The Posterior and Metropolis Sampling&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now we multiply the likelihood and the prior together to arrive at the psoterior&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;script type=&quot;math/tex; mode=display&quot;&gt;p(\mu , \sigma ^2 | \underline{x} ) \propto \frac{1}{\sigma _{n+1}} \exp \left( - \frac{1}{2 \sigma ^2} \sum _i (x_i - \mu )^2 \right).&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now to make this a proper probability distribution it would need a normalaisation constant, in this simple case, the constant is trivial. Butwe will not be calculating to illustrate the case when you the constant is not trivial.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, how do we understand what the posterior looks like if we haven’t got an exact expression for it? We sample from it, in such a way that the normalising constant isn’t needed. There are a number of alogrithms that can do this, but first we weill start off with Metropolis sampling.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This algorithm works by taking as follows:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Initialise &lt;script type=&quot;math/tex&quot;&gt;\theta&lt;/script&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Propose candidate parameter, &lt;script type=&quot;math/tex&quot;&gt;\theta _{\text{cand}}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;table&gt;
      &lt;tbody&gt;
        &lt;tr&gt;
          &lt;td&gt;Calculate the ratio of posteriors $$r = \frac{p(\theta _{\text{cand}}&lt;/td&gt;
          &lt;td&gt;\bfseries{x})}{p(\theta_{old}&lt;/td&gt;
          &lt;td&gt;\bfseries{x})}$$.&lt;/td&gt;
        &lt;/tr&gt;
      &lt;/tbody&gt;
    &lt;/table&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Calculate $$\alpha = \min \left[ 1, r \right].&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;We accept $$\theta _{\text{cand}}$ with probability $\alpha$ and add it to the list of sampled points.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The list of &lt;script type=&quot;math/tex&quot;&gt;\theta&lt;/script&gt; is the sample from the posterior.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;example&quot;&gt;Example&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To see this algorithm in practise it is easy enough to write the functions in R and generate some test data. For this we generate 100 normally distributed points with&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Learning How To Learn</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;As part of my first year as a grad student I am currently enrolled on a course “Researchers Profesional Development” and our first assignment is to briefly review a selected article on “proffesionalism”. Initially I was skeptical about the overall impact the module would have on my grad school life, but after reading the article I feel the module will offer a good alternative to constant numbers from my other couress.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I chose to read and review Teaching Smart People How to Learn by Chris Argyris. The article focuesed on the behaviour of management consultants when it came to reviewing their personal performance. I get the general feeling that when it comes to “proffesionalism” my experience in the financial world is comparable at least in culture to that of consulting, therefore this felt like a relatable article.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Single loop and double loop learning are introduced as concepts. 
*Single loop is the process of learning a task and performing it well when asked. 
*Double loop is looking at this task critically; looking for ways to improve it and its impact.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The author found that managment consultants were performing in a single loop mannor when one would think that they would be very addept at double loop learning, as essentially a large part of managment consulting is educating others. By delving into this disparity the author felt that the lack of double loop learning is due to the managment consultants not being able to learn. Why did they not wish to learn?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was thought that looking upon oneselfs critically was an embarssing task and that they themselves might not be up to the high standards that they set for themselves. This type of emotion stems from someone that is not used to failure, i.e. an academically succesfull managment consultant. By not failing, they have not been presented with opportuniuties to learn from this failure. This eventually becomes self perpetuatin and creates a week link between failure and learning oppurtunites. If you need to learn does that mean you have failed previously?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This culture of blame seems to be prevelant in the all walks of life, how often has one blamed the lecturer for being a poor teacher after receiving a bad mark in an exam? Or even the classic “a good workman never blames his tools”. Particulary in the finance world we see blame being layed out after key events, LIBOR fixing being a current hot topic. In the future, after the guilty have recieved the relevant punishment do we konw that the higher ups, both in government and those guilty have learnt from the mistakes?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This leads on to the conclusions drawn in the paper, that for a culture of blame and lack of learning to stop internal changes right from the very top need to change. A “trickle down economics” approach that prehaps is an easy to write but hard to implement solution. In my (limited) experience to reduce a blame culture more accountabil;ity should stand with those more experieced teaching those less experienced, with clear hand over procedures when the student becomes the teacher.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overall, the paper was a great explanation of why high performing individuals act and learn in a certain way and as an aspiring high performance individual I’ll have to keep the points made when I come across failure!&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>The First Workshop</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;On Friday the 25th of September I took myself along to King’s College to attend the London-Paris Bachelier Workshop on Mathematical Finance. It was a two day event designed to highlight the collaboration between London and Parisian universities in the maths and finance field. As a new graduate student of this field I thought it was a good opportunity to attend.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whilst there were many interesting topics, the stand out talk for me was John Armstrong on stochastic filtering. By projecting a stochastic equation onto a manifold and choosing an appropriate metric, an approximate solution can be found. The exact details are a bit beyond my grasp and I hope that I haven’t misinterpreted the overall aim of the talk. I hope that in the future I can look back on this and re-write it with a better understanding!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overall, the workshop was an excellent introduction to what to expect as a grad student and I look forward to attending more.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Prop Shop Interviews</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I thought I would try my hand at applying to a few proprietary trading firms in London. Having read Scott Pattersons books (Dark Pools and Quants) I felt like I had a decent grasp on the industry and felt that my skills from physics would set me up well for a trading job.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What I didn’t bank on was a minefield of an interview experience that involved calculator like tasks, running through matrix algebra and computer science terms that I had a ‘brief skim over wikipedia’ knowledge of. So here’s a run down of both interviews for each company.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first one was an hour long, asked a few questions of my experience at UBS before jumping into the maths.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Consider a bag with 3 balls; each a different colour. You remove 2 balls, paint them one colour and replace the balls in the bag. What’s the expected amount of moves before all the balls are the same colour?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My first instinct was to set up the transition matrix and take it from there. Points for correctly identifying that it was a Markov chain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I believed that the transition matrix would be a 3x3 matrix as there are three possible states that the bag could be in:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;All the balls are different colours.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;One ball is a different colour to the other two.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;All the balls are the same colour.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is correct, but not the ‘smart’ way to do. As the first move always takes the system from state 1 to state 2 you can simplify the matrix to just a 2x2 but remembering to add one to the average at the end.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now to calculate the transition probabilities. If we call state 1 the state in which there are two of one colour and one of the other and state 2 as all balls the same colour.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From state 1, there are two possibilities when drawing two balls. You pick two balls that are the same colour; this returns you too the same state. You chose two different colour balls, if you paint them the same colour as the remaining one, then the system is in the final state. If you paint them one of the other two colours, then the system stays in the same state.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This amounts to the probability of the system becoming fixed after one move:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;script type=&quot;math/tex; mode=display&quot;&gt;P(\text{fixed}) = \frac{1}{3} \cdot \frac{1}{3} + \frac{1}{3} \cdot \frac{1}{3} = \frac{2}{9}&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Therefore the expected number of transitions is the reciprocal of this fixation probability. BUT plus an extra one, due to the first move.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Therefore the average number of transitions is:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;script type=&quot;math/tex; mode=display&quot;&gt;N = \frac{9}{2} + 1 = \frac{11}{2}&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second question was to write a function that would reverse a linked list. This was a bit daunting seens as my familiarity with linked lists is next to none. But, in truth, I understand what pointers are, therefore a linked list isn’t something too abstract.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My first thought out loud ended up transpiring to reading the node pointers one by one into a new array and then returning the array. This is wrong, as the function then doesn’t return a linked list explicitly, instead just a list of pointers. It then clicked that I was going to have to change what way the pointer was pointing for each element in the list and this would involve a temporary variable. However, my use of temporary variable on reflection was not correct and whilst in the process of writing this post I realise that my solution was very incorrect.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the second interview, the questions asked were much less involved and basic maths but where you had to invoke a few tricks. For example, &lt;script type=&quot;math/tex&quot;&gt;41 \times 39&lt;/script&gt; is daunting withouta calculator, or at least it was to me. However, it can be simplified to &lt;script type=&quot;math/tex&quot;&gt;(40+1)(40-1) = 40 ^2 - 1 = 1599&lt;/script&gt;. After four questions were answered, I was then asked to estimate my confidence that I had answered them all correctly. I was 100% confident on 3 of them but less so on 1 other, therefore I believe a 75% confidence level would be sufficient.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overall, both interviews have highlighted the skills needed to succeed in these types of interviews. Tautology, but both times I asked catheter the interviewer used any of the topics in their daily work. They said no.&lt;/p&gt;
