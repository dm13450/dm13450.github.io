        <title>Playing About with Shiny</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;As an update to my MPhys project, I am currently building a webapp using the R package shiny to display the data from the simulations that have been run. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It has been almost too easy to use, basically just a few user interface lessons and playing around with how the app looks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The app flow is as follows: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The app grep’s in the directory for the unique ID of the data file that has been chosen. &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;It then plots the displacement, velocity and variance graph using ggplot with a custom theme. This is basically the black and white theme (theme_bw()) with removal of y label markings.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;For a given user inputed time stamp, the app outputs the distribution of the populations. A red marker point is displayed on the previous graphs to indicate where that time occurs. &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The fitness and mutation landscapes are drawn below the population graph to easily show whether the cloud is in a trap etc. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What I am most pleased about this app is the interactivity and ability to view the populations at a given interval. While not exactly the most “physicsy” bit of the project, it will help communicate the results of the data. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Further work can be done to generally improve the aesthetic look of the app. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A link will be added to the app once it is fully fit for public consumption! &lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Playing About with ggplot</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I’ve turned the spellchecker on right away for this post. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After spending the last few hours playing around with some data in R, I’ve managed to produce my first pretty looking graphic using ggplot2.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The main complication in producing this was fiddling around with the dataframe, getting it in the correct format so that the different colours of the line came out automatically. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Initially, it started off as: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;Timestep | Zero | One | Two  
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However this gave some complications; when ggplot was grouping the data, I had to refactor the data to:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;Timestep | Population | Mutation 
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This meant that I didn’t have to start manually setting colours, instead it was all decided for me. 
I like to follow the LaTeX school of thought by letting the software decide on the aesthetics that work best, rather that leaving it up to the user. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overall, it resulted in the following plot: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/InitialDemoGraph280914.png&quot; alt=&quot;First with ggplot&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The data came from a basic and rough implementation of the Gillespie Algorithm.
More comments on the physics behind it to follow.  &lt;/p&gt;

        <title>That First Blog Post</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;After finally finding some spare time I’ve got round to creating my own website/blog. Let it be a place for rambling about anything I encounter and my learning process on this web design front.&lt;br /&gt;
My main accomplishment today was managing to create my own LinkedIn sprite and link to compliment the github one down below. It involved tinkering with the SVG file and clawing at the basic HTML knowledge receding in my brain from year 7. But I’ve managed to implement it, maybe in the future once I’m a bit more confident I’ll try and get it incorporated into the basic theme, possibly my first open source contribution. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tomorrow’s priority is to see if you can get a spell checker in Vim and overcome my Achilles heel of abysmal spelling. But for now, lets hit commit and make sure it works once uploaded.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;21/09/14 Update. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Turned on the spell checker and corrected the entire post. Way too many mistakes to be proud of; still another learning point. &lt;/p&gt;
