<p>On Wednesday I took a stroll down to King’s College across the river for a seminar on data. Whilst that sounds like a broad term for a conference the topic and themes of the talks were on the innovative useage of data in fields were the data useage is less obvious and more unique.</p>

<p>The first talk was by Charlotte Rouche of the Kings college archaelogical department. She highlighted how maps play an important role in her archealogical research, both anchient and current maps. Understanding how the land is divided and even the names of places in various languages gives an important insight into how civilistation has evoloved. Mapping data is now ubiquitous with the likes of Google Maps and Google Earth and this can be useful in observing how an area has changed over time. The arial photographs of sites of archealogical interest cna be peroodically monitored for change and help with preservation.</p>

<p>The second talk was by Kate Bowers of the Crime Science department at UCL. She showed how the GPS data collected from police cars can provide maps of frequant patrol paths of the Metropolitan police. Combinging this with 999 call moitering she was able to give an indication of where there was defficienes in policing were arising. This can lead to policy implementation and a more efficient patrol path for police officers.</p>

<p>The third talk was by Robert Stewart. He was a mental health doctor from the NHS and Professor at King’s. Now I have previously worked for a NHS trust in the IT department and have an understanding of different software systems available for NHS trusts and the various data sharing rules in place. Interestingly, his trust has developed a searchable, anonymous database for mental health researchers. This allowed them to queery various parameters across paitent groups. A very interesting reserach tool that required individual paitent consent. Its success shows that it is possible to use the health data of patients to answer clinical questions and currently it is being used to help moniter drug saftey and other questions that requrie long term monitering.</p>

<p>The final talk was based on finding adversieres on the interent and looking at how such actors can make themselves known unwillingly. This talk was given by Thomas Rid from the War Studies department at King’s. He offered the example of the Poseta email <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Podesta_emails">leak</a>. By using the classic “reset you password here” phishing scam, Podesta clicked on a bitly link that populated a fake webpage with his gmail information and required him to submit his password to change it. Instead changing the password button just submit his password to the adversirary. We know that this was the vector chosen by the attackers due to the public nature of the bitly account. Whoever set the account up forgot to set the profile to private. This lead to the account being traced back  to some actor. Who it actually was is up to speculation at the time of writing.</p>

<p>Overall, it was an enjoyable confernece. I learnt about some new domains and in a more focused and “apply-side” way. It was less about alogrithm run times and more about what the algorithms actually do and how they can be used.</p>
