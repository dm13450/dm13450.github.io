title: Films and Books of February
date: 2016-02-03
***</p>

<p>Carrying from last months post and an in an attempt to make a habit out of writing I am going to have a look at the films and books consumed in February. 
This time I’ve ordered them roughly on how good they are.</p>

<p>** Films</p>

<ul>
  <li>Spotlight</li>
  <li>The Big Short</li>
  <li>What We Do In The Shadows</li>
  <li>Edge of Tomorrow</li>
  <li>Alien and Aliens</li>
  <li>Bridge of Spies</li>
</ul>

<p>Spotlight and The Big Short are going to find themselves tough to beat in 2016. Both stellar films highlighting the state of corruption in our society albeit with different tones.</p>

<p>Moving onto the more lighthearted films, What We Do In The Shadows (WWDITS) is an original, low budgety comedy that will make you laugh. It takes on the mockumentary approach adds a supernatural spin. It takes all the good parts from The Inbetweeners, The Office and vampire lore and package them into a film. This is what WWDITS essentially is. I look forward to a sequal and more from the director. 
Speaking again of originallity, Edge of Tomorrow will take any viewer back to there childhood. It’s got robots, aliens, high tech weaponary and a respawning mechanic. If you want a film to watch on a saturday night after the X-Factor has finished you’d be hard pressed to find something as enjoyable as Edge of Tomorrow.</p>

<p>Bridge of Spies fell a bit to me. Like last months Legend viewing, Bridge of Spies couldn’t deciede whether it wanted to be a courtroom drama or more focused on the negotiation aspect between East Germany and Russia. As a result you got two unsatisfactory parts of the film. It also had the usual Spielberg quirks: a moment of two people talking over each other, the main character going from being hated to being loved as if public opinion is that black and white. By all means it is a good film, but nothing more. Watch it once and continue with your life.</p>

<p>Finally, inspired by a play-through of Alien: Isolation on the PS4 I decieded to eduacte myself in the actual films. Alien had the very ‘classical’ sci-fi feel to it, with the beeping terminals, robots so realistic they pass of as humans and finally actual people in rubber suits opposed to CGI. Watching it takes you into that world and makes you nostalgic for the alternate timeline where computers fill rooms and sleeping pods. The influence it has on cinema is easily digested and thankfully doesn’t move into the ‘Seinfield is unfunny’ trope. Similarly, Aliens takes the same angle, although much less delicate. There are even paralels to Edge of Tomorrow and Aliens.</p>

<p>** Books</p>

<ul>
  <li>Flash Boys</li>
  <li>Chris Hadfield’s Autobiography</li>
  <li>The Art of Deception</li>
  <li>Crytopnomicon</li>
</ul>

<p>Throughout January I was a slave to the behomoth that is Cryprtonomicon and I’m ashamed to say that I still haven’t finished it. I’m 600 pages in and still feel like the proper story is yet to start. Everynow and then one of the characters goes on an arc that has me turning pages, but that usually finishes at the end of the chapter and then the book loses momentum and I find myself looking at the back trying to work out how many pages I need to read a day to finish before the next leap year. For this reason I think I’m going to have to relegate Crytonomicon to the unfinished pile.</p>

<p>Moving onto the non-fiction books it has been a mixture of finance, space and security. 
With the debate of IEX continually appearing on my Twitter timeline and my Phd work touching it’s toes in microstructure, Flash Boys has been on my to-read list for a while. I’m still strugling to form an opinion on the morality of HFT even after reading it. I feel like the majority of what is described in Flash Boys can be categorised as market impact. If you place a large order, other traders are going to adjust there prices. The finite nature of passing messages back and forth from exchanges means that there will be information asymetry and thus arbitrage oppurunities.</p>

<p>From low latency to high latency, Chris Hadfield’s book is a simple and consice account of his time training and actual time in space on various missions. I enjoyed it for the insight into the organisation of NASA and how as a Canadian there is a slightly different path to becoming a spaceman. I imagine it’s similar to the UK and becoming part of the ESA crew. 
Whilst the book is an easy read, I found it a bit light on the details and prehaps a bit of negativity to give it a bit of balance. It felt much like a good PR read for NASA and many of it’s weaknesses were actually it’s strenghts. I.e. the flat organisational structure that means that returning astronaughts are placed bottom of the pile. Much like Alex Fergusan said, no player bigger than the club - no astronaught bigger than NASA.</p>
