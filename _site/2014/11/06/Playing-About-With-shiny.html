  <article class="post-content">
    <p>As an update to my MPhys project, I am currently building a webapp using the R package shiny to display the data from the simulations that have been run. </p>

<p>It has been almost too easy to use, basically just a few user interface lessons and playing around with how the app looks.</p>

<p>The app flow is as follows: </p>

<ol>
  <li>The app grep’s in the directory for the unique ID of the data file that has been chosen. </li>
  <li>It then plots the displacement, velocity and variance graph using ggplot with a custom theme. This is basically the black and white theme (theme_bw()) with removal of y label markings.</li>
  <li>For a given user inputed time stamp, the app outputs the distribution of the populations. A red marker point is displayed on the previous graphs to indicate where that time occurs. </li>
  <li>The fitness and mutation landscapes are drawn below the population graph to easily show whether the cloud is in a trap etc. </li>
</ol>

<p>What I am most pleased about this app is the interactivity and ability to view the populations at a given interval. While not exactly the most “physicsy” bit of the project, it will help communicate the results of the data. </p>

<p>Further work can be done to generally improve the aesthetic look of the app. </p>

<p>A link will be added to the app once it is fully fit for public consumption! </p>
