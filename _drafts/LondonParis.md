On Friday the 25th of September I took myself along to King's College to attend the *London-Paris Maths/Finance Workshop*. It was a two day event, designed to highlight the collaboration between London and Parisian universities in the maths and finance field. As a new graduate student of the finance field I thought it was a good oppurtunity to attend. 

Whilst there were many interesting topics, the standout talk for me was *John Armstrong's* on stochastic filtering. The paper can be found *here*.

*Mention the Zakai equation. 
*Previous use of similar techniques in different fields. 
*How the filtering can be used in practise. 


Overall, the *London-Paris* Maths/Finace workshop was an excellent introduction to what to expect as a gread student and I look forward to attending more.
