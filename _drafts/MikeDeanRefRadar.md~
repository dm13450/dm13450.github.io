title: Mike Dean and the Ref Radar
---

It was a tough day at the office last week for Mike Dean. After dismissing Feghouli in the 15th minute the tempo of the game changed, putting West Ham on the back foot and eventually led to Man Utd winning 0-2. Undeniably the red card had a big effect on the outcome of the game. It has since been rescinded showing - the FA agree with fans that perhaps it should not have been a red card. 

There has also been a tweet circulating that Mike Dean in his last 7 Tottenham games has sent of three opposition players. Which on first reading raises some eyebrows. So a prime opportunity to explore our RefRadar of Mike Dean and see how he compares.

Lets look at the season so far (2016/17) in isolation.

So as we can see here, Mike Dean does like penalising the away team more than the home team for both fouls and yellow cards. Obviously these two stats are going to be correlated. But it is still interesting to see how he is fairly close to the average amount for penalising the Home Team, but for the Away Team he is frequently giving fouls and yellow cards out.
