title: Things I've learnt about PDE's

For my Masters project, I have a PDE that I need to solve to gain some insight on the dynamics of cancer cells in a fixed population. Having only used the simpleset of partial differential equations previously, i.e. heat equation, wave equation and the Black Schole's, my knowledge on solving a 'general' PDE was limited. 

Firstly, PDE's can be classified depending on their coefficients.
