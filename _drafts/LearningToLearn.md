As part of my first year as a grad student I am currently enrolled on a course "Researchers Profesional Development" and our first assignment is to briefly review a selected article on "proffesionalism". Initially I was skeptical about the overall impact the module would have on my grad school life, but after reading the article I feel the module will offer a good alternative to constant numbers from my other couress. 

I chose to read and review Teaching Smart People How to Learn by Chris Argyris. The article focuesed on the behaviour of management consultants when it came to reviewing their personal performance. I get the general feeling that when it comes to "proffesionalism" my experience in the financial world is comparable at least in culture to that of consulting, therefore this felt like a relatable article. 

Single loop and double loop learning are introduced as concepts. 
*Single loop is the process of learning a task and performing it well when asked. 
*Double loop is looking at this task critically; looking for ways to improve it and its impact. 

The author found that managment consultants were performing in a single loop mannor when one would think that they would be very addept at double loop learning, as essentially a large part of managment consulting is educating others. By delving into this disparity the author felt that the lack of double loop learning is due to the managment consultants not being able to learn. Why did they not wish to learn? 

It was thought that looking upon oneselfs critically was an embarssing task and that they themselves might not be up to the high standards that they set for themselves. This type of emotion stems from someone that is not used to failure, i.e. an academically succesfull managment consultant. By not failing, they have not been presented with opportuniuties to learn from this failure. This eventually becomes self perpetuatin and creates a week link between failure and learning oppurtunites. If you need to learn does that mean you have failed previously? 

This culture of blame seems to be prevelant in the all walks of life, how often has one blamed the lecturer for being a poor teacher after receiving a bad mark in an exam? Or even the classic "a good workman never blames his tools". Particulary in the finance world we see blame being layed out after key events, LIBOR fixing being a current hot topic. In the future, after the guilty have recieved the relevant punishment do we konw that the higher ups, both in government and those guilty have learnt from the mistakes? 

This leads on to the conclusions drawn in the paper, that for a culture of blame and lack of learning to stop internal changes right from the very top need to change. A "trickle down economics" approach that prehaps is an easy to write but hard to implement solution. In my (limited) experience to reduce a blame culture more accountabil;ity should stand with those more experieced teaching those less experienced, with clear hand over procedures when the student becomes the teacher. 

Overall, the paper was a great explanation of why high performing individuals act and learn in a certain way and as an aspiring high performance individual I'll have to keep the points made when I come across failure!
