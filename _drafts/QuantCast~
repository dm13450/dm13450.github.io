title: Notes from a QuantCast Talk 
---


As I sit on the train to London waiting for my model to finish fitting I realised that it had been a while since I had written a blog post. 

My PhD school holds a bimonthly seminar and this weeks guest speaker was Dr. Peter Day who is a director of engineering at QuantCast. *Add link here. 

Now QuantCast is a 21st century advertising agency offering real time advertisment strategy and analytics. The lecture was based around their use of data and how statistics and infrastructure has helped make advertising more relevant and serve better adds. 

My first `did you know` was that the adverts you see on websites are sold in real time as you load the page. So in the time it takes from clicking a link on goole to the page apearing in your browser, the add space has been bought microseconds earlier and now serving a specific add designed for you.
