title: Bayesian Autoregressive Processes

An autoregressive process can be described by the equation $$y_t = c + \phi*y_{t-1} + \epsilon$$. The parameter $c$ is some baseline, $\phi$ if between -1 and 1, and $\epsilon$ is some white noise process. If we consult the Wikipedia artivle on such process we find that there it is fairly trivial to calculate the unknown parameter $$\phi$$ in a frequentist setting. Googling about for a Bayesian introduction didn't turn up anything particulary helpful, so here I try and plug that gap. 

For any Bayesian method we need to decompose our problem into three parts; likelihood, prior and posterior distribution.  

For the likelihood we can see that each observation $y_i$ is normally distributed around $\phi y_{i-1}$
