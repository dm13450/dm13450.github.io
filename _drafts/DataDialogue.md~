title: Data Dialogue Meeting
---

On Wednesday I took a stroll down to King's College across the river for a seminar on data. Whilst that sounds like a broad term for a conference the topic and themes of the talks were on the innovative useage of data in fields were the data useage is less obvious and more unique.

The first talk was by Charlotte Rouche of the Kings college archaelogical department. She highlighted how maps play an important role in her archealogical research, both anchient and current maps. Understanding how the land is divided and even the names of places in various languages gives an important insight into how civilistation has evoloved. Mapping data is now ubiquitous with the likes of Google Maps and Google Earth and this can be useful in observing how an area has changed over time. The arial photographs of sites of archealogical interest cna be peroodically monitored for change and help with preservation.
