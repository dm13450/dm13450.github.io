title: Thoughts on Weights in Bayesian Regression

Weighted regression is common in frequentist approaches in modelling the link between multiple variables. Typically, the weights are known and can be interpreted as the amount each datapoint is allowed to influence the regression. Therefore, using weighted regression can also be a useful tool in building robust regression models - ones that are less suseceptable to outliers. However, when it comes to adding in weights in a Bayesian regression problem the intuition falls apart.
